    "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello! I see that you were referred to our hospital for a lung adenocarcinoma measuring 28 mm in your right upper lobe. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: We have planned a UVATS procedure to resect the tumor. Are you familiar with this procedure?\nPatient: Not really, can you explain it to me?\nDoctor: Of course. During the procedure, you will be placed in the left lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia. We will then make a 4-cm skin incision for the main port in the sixth intercostal space at the anterior axillary line.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: A wound retractor will be used to allow the insertion of a flexible thoracoscope, endoscopic autosuturing device, and vessel-sealing device via the main port incision. This will also allow us to extract the specimen after the operation.\nPatient: Hmm, I understand.\nDoctor: During the operation, we found an incomplete interlobar fissure between the upper and middle lobe, as well as abnormal lobulation of the upper lobe. Therefore, we carried out a modified marionette technique.\nPatient: What does that involve?\nDoctor: First, an Internal organ retractor was inserted into the thoracic cavity using a clip applier. This allowed the retractor to grasp the targeted lung parenchyma properly.\nPatient: Okay.\nDoctor: Second, we prepared two sets of looped 1-0 nylon-threaded 18-gauge injection needles. These needles were optimally pierced through the thoracic wall separately.\nPatient: And then what happened?\nDoctor: Finally, both ends of the 1-0 nylon thread attached to the Internal organ retractor were pulled out through the looped nylon. This allowed us to perform the procedure more effectively.\nPatient: I see. So, what are the follow-up requirements for this procedure?\nDoctor: You will need regular check-ups and monitoring to ensure that the tumor has been completely removed and that there are no complications. We will provide you with more information regarding your follow-up appointments.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate the explanation.\nDoctor: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask. We're here to help.\nPatient: I think I understand everything now. Thanks again.\nDoctor: No problem, take care, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment.",

Can you tell me more about that and if you've experienced any other hair loss on your body?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've noticed my eyebrows have been thinning, but I haven't experienced hair loss anywhere else on my body.\nDoctor: Alright. Have you done anything to your eyebrows in the past, like plucking them with tweezers?\nPatient: Yes, I used to shape my eyebrows by plucking them with tweezers.\nDoctor: Do you have any other medical conditions or concerns that you'd like me to be aware of?\nPatient: No, I don't have any other medical conditions.\nDoctor: Okay, let me examine your eyebrows and other areas on your body to check for any signs of alopecia. *Examines patient* I see sparse and thin black hairs on your eyebrows but no signs of hair loss elsewhere, such as your frontal hairline or temporal area. \nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: Based on my examination, I'm diagnosing you with idiopathic eyebrow hypotrichosis. I'm going to prescribe you a bimatoprost 0.03% solution to apply to the affected areas daily. \nPatient: Okay, thank you.\nDoctor: Just so you know, improvement in your eyebrow hypotrichosis will be gradual, so you'll need to be patient.

    "dialogue": "Doctor: Good morning, ma'am. I see you were admitted to the emergency department with a complaint of palpitations that started a few hours ago. Can you describe the palpitations for me?\nPatient: Hi, doctor. Yeah, my heart has been beating really fast and irregularly for the past few hours. It's quite uncomfortable.\nDoctor: I understand. We've done a 12-lead ECG, which suggests that you have atrial fibrillation. I also noticed in your medical history that you've been taking oral anticoagulation therapy for recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation and topiramate for essential tremor in your arms. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I've had these issues before, and the medications help manage them.\nDoctor: After you were admitted, we administered an intravenous dose of amiodarone to help with your current symptoms. Your new 12-lead ECG is now compatible with atrial flutter, having a cycle length of 240 ms and a 4:1 atrioventricular response.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What does that mean?\nDoctor: Atrial flutter is a different type of abnormal heart rhythm, but it's related to atrial fibrillation. The cycle length and atrioventricular response we observed indicate that your heart rhythm has changed, but it's still not regular.\nPatient: I see. So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We wanted to further evaluate the underlying heart rhythm, so we performed a two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography (2D TTE) on you. This is an ultrasound of your heart to see how it's functioning.\nPatient: And what did you find?\nDoctor: We measured the transmitral flow using pulsed-wave Doppler and found a diastolic pattern with a normal atrial rhythm. This means that your heart is functioning relatively well despite the abnormal rhythm.\nPatient: That's a relief. What do we do now?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your heart rhythm and adjust your medications as needed. It's important for you to keep taking your prescribed medications and follow up with your cardiologist regularly for further evaluation and management.\nPatient: Alright, doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll make sure to follow up with my cardiologist and take my medications as prescribed.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns, do not hesitate to contact your healthcare team or come back to the emergency department. Take care and stay safe.",

Can you tell me more about your medical history?\nPatient: Yes, three years before admission, I was diagnosed with ITP through laboratory tests, including antibodies against platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and GP IV, and bone marrow aspiration. I was treated successfully with corticosteroids. I also have a history of nontuberculosis mycobacterial infection.\nDoctor: I see. What treatment were you on before coming here?\nPatient: I was taking prednisolone, clarithromycin, rifampicin, and ethambutol hydrochloride.\nDoctor: Okay. I have your recent examination results here. Two weeks before admission, your platelet counts were normal, at 185 × 10^9/l. However, on admission, your laboratory findings showed a significant drop in platelet count, to 3.0 × 10^9/l. Your biochemical parameters and coagulation values were within the normal limit, and antibodies against Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and HIV were negative. Based on this, we diagnosed you with acute exacerbation of chronic ITP.\nPatient: Oh, no. What will be my treatment now?\nDoctor: We started you on high-dose IVIG, PSL (40 mg/day), and romiplostim (1 µg/kg). However, during the next four days, you developed respiratory failure with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of approximately 250. We performed a computed tomography (CT) on the fourth day of hospitalization, which revealed ground-glass opacities with marginal infiltration in both lung fields. This led us to diagnose you with alveolar hemorrhage. \nPatient: That's terrible. What happened next?\nDoctor: As your dyspnea worsened gradually, we initiated noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) to help you breathe. On the 11th day of hospitalization, we increased the dose of romiplostim to 10 µg/kg and administered pulsed doses of methyl-PSL (1000 mg/day for 3 days) along with a second cycle of IVIG.\nPatient: Did that help?\nDoctor: Yes, by the 21st day of hospitalization, your platelet count recovered, and you were discharged without any complications.\nPatient: That's a relief. What's my current situation?\nDoctor: Your platelet count has remained normal while being treated with 12.5 mg of prednisolone.

Your hemoglobin is 10.8 g/dL, prothrombin time (PT) is 10.5 seconds, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is 29 seconds, international normalized ratio is 2.3, and platelet count is 385x109/L.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We also performed a transabdominal sonography and magnetic resonance imaging on you. The results show total placenta previa and myometrial invasion to the urinary bladder at the anterior wall of your uterus. \nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, it can be. You mentioned earlier that you would prefer a conservative approach rather than hysterectomy in case of massive bleeding, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After the cesarean delivery of your baby through a Pfannenstiel incision and removal of the placenta, we detected a 5-6 cm area of tissue loss at the anterior wall of the uterus. There was also bleeding from the cervix and posterior wall of the bladder.\nPatient: Oh no, what did you do?\nDoctor: We applied pelvic packing on the pelvic vessels for 20 minutes and sutured the bleeding sites with 1.0 polyglactine sutures. We also placed a Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon catheter in the uterus before suturing.\nPatient: And did that help?\nDoctor: We filled the stomach balloon with 250 mL saline and the esophageal balloon with 400 mL saline to provide compression on the lower uterine isthmic and cervical bleeds. However, bleeding continued.\nPatient: What happened next?\nDoctor: Bilateral uterine and hypogastric artery ligations were planned due to the hemorrhage. During the procedure, the left external iliac artery was accidentally held and bonded as the left hypogastric artery, but we released it within a minute after distinguishing the vessels.\nPatient: Oh, I see. \nDoctor: Following that, we successfully ligated the uterine and hypogastric arteries on both sides. You lost about 2000 cc of blood due to the intraoperative hemorrhage, which we measured by adding 1650 cc blood in the aspirator and counting the gauzes.\nPatient: That's a lot of blood.\nDoctor: Yes, it is.

Can you tell me how long you've been experiencing this discomfort?\nPatient: Yeah, it's been going on for about 3 weeks now.\nDoctor: I see. I also noted that you have a history of being injured by missile fragments 11 years before your admission. Can you tell me more about that?\nPatient: Sure, I'm in the military and got injured during a mission. I've had some issues since then, but this pain is new.\nDoctor: Okay. Your previous doctor suspected a probable diagnosis of S1 root radiculopathy from L5–S1 disc herniation and performed a lumbar myelography, which came back normal. However, since you still have discomfort, they referred you to our institution. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: I conducted a neurological exam and found distal sciatica along the course of your S1 root, with hypoesthesia of your right sole. Upon further examination and palpation, I discovered a painful and pulsatile mass in your popliteal region. I also heard a bruit during auscultation. Based on these findings, I suspected a pseudoaneurysm and ordered a selective angiography.\nPatient: Oh, what did that reveal?\nDoctor: The angiography revealed a pseudoaneurysm arising from the proximal segment of your anterior tibial artery. The artery appears to be bowed due to the compressive effect of the pseudoaneurysms.\nPatient: So, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Considering there was a difference between the size of the aneurysm in angiography and the size of the mass during palpation, I ordered a contrasted CT scan to estimate the exact size of the aneurysm. The scan showed a large isointense mass with rim enhancement surrounding a hyperdense area. The rim is compatible with the pseudocapsule of the aneurysm. The isointense mass is an old clot, and the hyperdense area is the patent part of the aneurysm.\nPatient: That sounds pretty serious. What's the next step?\nDoctor: We will need to consult with a vascular specialist to discuss treatment options for the pseudoaneurysm. You may require surgical intervention.

During the transfer to the hospital, cardiac massage was performed for 40 minutes to try and revive him. Upon arrival, we assessed his condition and found him to be in a deep coma with a Glasgow score of 3/15. That's a very low score and indicates a severe brain injury.\nFamily Member: Oh no... What did the tests show?\nDoctor: We performed an unenhanced Brain Computed Tomography (CT) after five hours. The images demonstrated bilateral hypodensity in the basal ganglia, which can be seen as the white arrowheads. There was also hyperdensity in the cerebral arteries, which seems to be related to the underlying brain hypodensity. This is likely due to a decrease in gray-white differentiation caused by edema, or swelling, in the brain.\nFamily Member: What happened next?\nDoctor: We continued to monitor his condition and performed another unenhanced CT after 30 hours. Unfortunately, there was progression of brain edema, causing a collapse of the sylvian fissures, basal cisterns, and cortical sulci. These are indicated by the black arrows in the images.\nFamily Member: And what does that mean?\nDoctor: This also led to diffuse hyperdensity of all collapsed subarachnoid spaces, which became prominent and is indicated by the white arrows.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, that's correct. But in the last 20 days, the pain has worsened severely, and it's now radiating to the back of my lower limbs. I've also had a lot of difficulty walking.\nDoctor: I see. When I examined your lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints, I found that the palpation was painful, which is a positive Patrick's test. We also did some laboratory analysis, and your inflammatory markers, such as reactive C protein, were found to be normal. Are you aware of any other health issues or habits that could be related to your condition?\nPatient: Well, I am a heavy smoker, but I don't have any other comorbidities.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. We performed an MRI, which demonstrated an infiltrative mass affecting the vertebral body and pedicles of your L4 vertebra. There was also heterogeneous enhancement after the contrast administration. The tumor has extended into the distal third of your inferior vena cava and the left iliopsoas muscle.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also performed a CT scan, which showed a lytic lesion with indistinct borders in the vertebral body of your fourth lumbar vertebra (L4). There was a soft tissue component that dislocated the aorta and the inferior vena cava. Additionally, there was a typical \"ring-and-arc\" chondroid matrix mineralization in the L4 vertebral body.\nPatient: What does this all mean, doc?\nDoctor: We decided to perform a needle transpedicular biopsy of the vertebral lesion to better understand your condition. The biopsy revealed a malignant infiltrative bone neoplasm with chondroid differentiation and several areas of necrosis.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: Three weeks after the needle biopsy, we performed a posterior lumbar approach, installing pedicle screws at L3 and L5, and removed the posterior elements. We also dissected the anterior large vessels from the spine and performed an \"en bloc\" resection of L4. We reconstructed your lumbar spine with a titanium cage and an anterolateral plate.\nPatient: And what were the results of that?\nDoctor: The histopathological examination of the resected L4 vertebral body revealed an infiltrative malignant biphasic neoplasia composed of ample ill-defined areas.\nPatient: What does this mean for my future treatment?\nDoctor: We will need to discuss further treatment options, including potential chemotherapy and radiation therapy, to target and manage the malignant neoplasm. It is crucial that you follow up with your medical team regularly to monitor your progress and adjust treatment as necessary.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

I've been having some discomfort in my groin area lately.\nDoctor: Alright, let me start by conducting a physical examination to better understand the situation. Is that okay with you?\nPatient: Yes, sure.\nDoctor: (After examining) Based on the physical examination, your phenotype seems like that of a 3-year-old boy with a normal size penis. I found a palpable testis in your left groin and a nonpalpable undescended testis on the right side.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that one of your testes hasn't descended to its proper location in the scrotum. We may need to do further tests like an MRI to get a clearer picture of what's going on.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n(After the MRI)\nDoctor: The MRI results show that your left testis is located in the left hemiscrotum, measuring 1.3 × 0.6 cm. It's associated with a mild hydrocele. Another testis, measuring 1.2 × 0.6 cm, was found on the ipsilateral side within the left inguinal canal.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: This means that both of your testes are on the same side, one above the other, which is unusual.

It seems difficult to expose and directly manipulate the orifice of the ARSA. \nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for my treatment?\nDoctor: In our institution, we routinely perform extra-anatomical subclavian artery bypass in TAR to simplify the surgical technique. We've decided to proceed with a hybrid TAR with bilateral extra-anatomical axillary artery bypass (adding extra-anatomical right axillary artery bypass) to avoid a deep and difficult end-to-end anastomosis of the ARSA.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. What does the procedure involve?\nDoctor: First, we'll connect two pieces of branch grafts (9 mm) to both your left and right axillary arteries, which will be connected to a selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) circuit. Then, we'll perform a median sternotomy.\nPatient: Median sternotomy? What's that?\nDoctor: It's a surgical procedure where we'll make an incision down the middle of your chest to access your heart and lungs. The ARSA is deeply located at just the right side of the main bronchus. We'll then initiate cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) via the ascending aorta and the superior and inferior venae cavae. A left ventricle vent will be inserted from the right superior pulmonary vein during systemic cooling.\nPatient: So, what happens after that?\nDoctor: We'll clamp the ascending aorta and achieve cardiac arrest with an antegrade cardioplegic solution. Then, the proximal anastomosis will be performed using a 4–0 prolene. When the temperature reaches 28°C, we'll start a hypothermic circulatory arrest with retrograde cerebral perfusion (RCP) to protect your brain and flush out atheromatous debris from the arch vessels.\nPatient: That sounds intense. What about the aneurysm and the ARSA?\nDoctor: Inside the aorta, we'll find many red-colored thrombi in the orifice of the ARSA. We'll ligate the ARSA just at the right side of the main bronchus and the left subclavian artery at the region of origin.\nPatient: I see.

Have you noticed any changes in how you feel since the SIRT?\nPatient: I feel somewhat better after the SIRT, but still not great.\nDoctor: I see. Well, the good news is that three months after the SIRT, your MRI showed virtually complete necrosis of the lesions that were observed in the previous MRI. Moreover, there were necrotic areas not showing the previous lesions. These findings may correspond to necrosis of recent secondary lesions or from the hepatic parenchyma. There's also a wedge-shaped hyperenhancement area that stands out around the lesion in segment VII.\nPatient: So, does that mean my condition is improving?\nDoctor: It appears that the SIRT has been effective in treating some of the hepatic lesions. However, we will need to continue monitoring your progress and adjust your treatment plan as necessary.\nPatient: What's the next step for me, doctor?\nDoctor: We will schedule follow-up appointments and imaging studies to observe the status of your hepatic lesions and pancreatic tumor. Depending on the results, we may need to consider additional treatments or modifications to your current plan.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We will do our best to help you manage your condition. If you have any concerns or further questions, please don't hesitate to ask.",
    "soap": "S: The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma diagnosed in March 2014 and multinodular hepatic metastasis. He reports feeling weak and tired most of the time. He experienced systemic toxicity with FOLFIRINOX and felt sick during the treatment. The patient felt slightly better with gemcitabine but still not great. He reports some improvement after SIRT but still feels not great.\nO: Initial chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX was discontinued due to toxicity. The patient was then treated with gemcitabine, showing partial response in the pancreatic tumor but progression in hepatic lesions and worsening tumor markers (CA19.9 increased from 2,100 to 18,000 U/mL). Post-second-line chemotherapy, abdominal MRI revealed growth of secondary hepatic lesions in segments II, IVa, VII, and VI. Post-SIRT, MRI showed virtually complete necrosis of these lesions and additional necrotic areas, suggesting effectiveness of SIRT. A wedge-shaped hyperenhancement area was noted around the lesion in segment VII.\nA: The primary diagnosis is pancreatic adenocarcinoma with hepatic metastasis. The patient has undergone multiple lines of chemotherapy with partial response and significant side effects. Recent SIRT treatment shows promising results with significant necrosis of hepatic lesions. Continuous monitoring is necessary to assess the progression of the disease and effectiveness of the treatment.\nP: The plan includes scheduling follow-up appointments and imaging studies to monitor the status of hepatic lesions and pancreatic tumor. Depending on the outcomes, adjustments to the treatment plan may be necessary. The patient will be informed about potential additional treatments based on the progression and response to the current treatment. Continuous support and information will be provided to address any concerns or questions from the patient."

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Are you currently taking any medications?\nPatient: I only take occasional iron supplements, but no regular medications.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history?\nPatient: I've had iron deficiency anaemia and a melanoma that was removed 13 years ago.\nDoctor: Thank you for that information. Is there anything else I should know about your medical history?\nPatient: Well, a year prior to this presentation, I had a 4-week admission where I experienced lingering depressive and anxiety symptoms after a presumed viral infection 6 months earlier. I had lethargy, intermittent headaches, nausea, diarrhoea, and unintentional weight loss of 16 Kg over a 6-month period.\nDoctor: And what was the outcome of that admission?\nPatient: Following a biochemical assessment, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and a CT abdomen, I was diagnosed with an episode of major depression and started on an antidepressant.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that. During your clinical examination today, we noticed that you demonstrated ataxia, as you were unable to walk heel-to-toe, had a negative Romberg's test, and showed subtle dysarthria. We didn't find any other focal neurology during the neurologic examination, and your cardiorespiratory examinations were unremarkable.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We arranged a CT brain for you, and it identified multifocal haemorrhagic sites in the right cerebellar and both cerebral hemispheres. The largest was a 3-cm right cerebellar lobar bleed. The report suggests differential diagnoses of haemorrhagic metastases, possibly recurrent melanoma, or an atypical presentation of amyloid angiopathy.\nPatient: That sounds serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it does require further investigation. We have started you on dexamethasone and referred you to the neurosurgical department. They will perform a staging CT chest/abdomen and pre-operative stealth brain MRI to further assess the right cerebellar lesion and obtain a histological diagnosis.\nPatient: What did the MRI show?\nDoctor: The MRI confirmed multiple supra- and infratentorial lesions. Haemosiderin staining was seen in multiple sulci at the vertex, which is in keeping with a low volume of subarachnoid blood. A 4 mm posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm was also detected.\nPatient: And what about the CT chest?\nDoctor: The CT chest identified a mass in the left atrium, which is concerning for an atrial myxoma. We will continue to investigate and determine the best course of action for your treatment.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.",

You have CAD risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, smoking, and hypertension. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: We performed a percutaneous coronary intervention to address this issue. Our expert operator guided the attending physician, who has 3 years of interventional experience. We conducted a coronary angiography through your right radial artery, which showed a 70% occlusion in the proximal segment of your left main anterior coronary artery (LM) and a 90% occlusion in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). \nPatient: Oh, okay.\nDoctor: We initially used a diagnostic catheter (6F TIG, TERUMO, Japan) which was withdrawn, and then advanced a hydrophilic guidewire (Merit Laureate; Merit Medical, USA). Unnoticed, it strayed into the distal right IMA. When the guiding catheter (6F EBU3.5, Medtronic, USA) was advanced over the guidewire, you complained of intolerable chest pain. Do you remember that?\nPatient: Yes, I remember the chest pain.\nDoctor: We immediately withdrew the guiding catheter and guidewire, then reintroduced the guidewire into the aortic sinus. We delivered the guiding catheter to the left coronary artery and performed balloon dilatation and stenting of the LM and LAD. During that time, you again complained of severe chest pain, and your blood pressure began to fall. \nPatient: Yeah, it was really painful.\nDoctor: Your condition deteriorated despite the administration of opioid analgesics and intravenous fluids. We performed a transthoracic echocardiography to rule out cardiac tamponade and aortic dissection, which it did. \nPatient: What did you find then?\nDoctor: Fluoroscopy suggested a right-sided pleural haemothorax (Fig. c). We conducted an IMA angiography that revealed obvious exudation of contrast in the third rib segment of the right IMA. To address this issue, we introduced a 2.0 mm × 15 mm semi-compliant balloon (MINI TREK, Abbott, IL, USA) up to the site of the leak and kept it inflated for 20 minutes to reduce the exudation.\nPatient: Did it help?\nDoctor: Yes, bleeding was finally staunched by embolization with coils (Fig).

I noticed in your records that you've worked as a plasterer for more than 40 years. Did you use any protective equipment during your work?\nPatient: No, I didn't use any protective equipment.\nDoctor: Okay. During the examination, we performed chest auscultation and noticed slight bilateral inspiratory fine crackles in the bilateral lower lung zones. We also conducted a chest X-ray, which showed enlarged hilar lymph nodes and mild reticular opacities, mainly in the upper to middle lung fields of both lungs.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We performed a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, which suggested a predominantly subpleural distribution of irregular linear opacities and reticulonodular shadows with interlobular septal thickening in both lung fields. However, your pulmonary function tests were close to normal, and your six-minute walking test during admission was also normal.\nPatient: That's a relief, at least.\nDoctor: In 2014, we noticed that your forced vital capacity (FVC) and diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) had decreased. The reticulonodular shadows on your HRCT scan had worsened as well.\nPatient: But I haven't felt any worse in terms of my symptoms.\nDoctor: That's interesting to note. Your thoracic symptoms had not deteriorated, and your vital signs remained stable. To establish a diagnosis, we performed VATS from the right S2 segment of the upper lung lobe and the right S9 segment of the lower lung lobe.\nPatient: What did you find?\nDoctor: We observed dense fibrosis with mononuclear cell infiltration and inorganic dust particles around the respiratory bronchioles in the upper lung lobe S2 segment, which is consistent with MDP. Additionally, we detected fibrously thickened interlobular septa and visceral pleura accompanied by dust, including some birefringent particles suggestive of silicates, and fibroblastic foci within these lesions.\nPatient: And what about the lower lung lobe?\nDoctor: In the lower lung lobe S9, we found extensive honeycomb changes with dilated bronchioles and parenchymal collapse, as well as fibroblastic foci within the cystic wall.\nPatient: So, what does this all mean, Doctor?\nDoctor: It means that your years of exposure to dust particles without proper protective equipment may have contributed to these findings in your lungs.

Pulmonary function tests were near normal, and a six-minute walking test was normal. VATS biopsy from the right upper and lower lung lobes showed dense fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltration, inorganic dust particles, and fibroblastic foci, consistent with mixed dust pneumoconiosis (MDP).\nA: The primary diagnosis is mixed dust pneumoconiosis, likely due to prolonged occupational exposure to dust without protective measures. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of interstitial lung disease, but the biopsy findings are highly suggestive of MDP. The prognosis depends on the progression of the lung disease and the effectiveness of the management plan.\nP: The management plan will include regular monitoring of lung function and symptoms, pulmonary rehabilitation, and consideration of pharmacological treatment to manage symptoms and slow disease progression.

You were diagnosed with essential hypertension two years ago, and it's controlled with Ramipril 10 mg once daily. Are there any other morbidities or medications you're taking?\nPatient: No, that's the only issue I have, and Ramipril is the only medication I take.\nDoctor: Great. Your preoperative assessment did not reveal any other abnormalities related to anesthesia, and your vital signs were normal.

However, there were no signs of snoring, apneic episodes, nocturnal dyspnea, or daytime somnolence. Were you aware of her sleep issues?\nPatient: No, we didn't know about her sleep issues until now.\nDoctor: Her arterial blood gas (ABG) test showed hypoxia accompanied by hypercapnia. Furthermore, her lung function test, using spirometry, revealed a decreased percent predicted vital capacity. This indicates some issues with her respiratory system. We will need to monitor and address this as part of her treatment plan.\nPatient: I see. Thank you for informing us about this. We will make sure to follow up on her treatment and monitor her condition closely.\nDoctor: You're welcome. It's important to keep a close eye on her health and follow the recommended treatment plan.

But I don't have any radicular pain.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms over time?\nPatient: Yes, there has been a progressive reduction in claudication distance. Also, my gait suddenly got worse, and I started experiencing urinary incontinence after a trivial fall last week.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. Let me share some findings from your examination. You have a bilateral high-stepping gait due to foot drop, symmetrical weakness of both the L4 and L5 roots (MRC grade 0/5), and partial weakness of the S1 root (MRC grade 3/5). You also have nondermatomal sensory disturbances and absent deep tendon reflexes in your lower limbs. Your anal tone is normal, but saddle anesthesia is present. \nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We performed a postvoidal ultrasonogram of your urinary bladder and found a residual urine volume of 250 ml, confirming a neurogenic bladder. We also conducted plain radiography of your lumbar spine, but it didn't show any gross feature of instability and was inconclusive. \nPatient: So, what's the issue then?\nDoctor: We did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of your lumbar spine and found a solitary intraspinal posterior epidural lesion of 1.8 × 1.5 × 0.5 cm at the L2-L3 level.

Other cell lines are normal with hemoglobin of 12.6 gm/dL and platelets of 242 k/μL. Your uric acid was elevated at 9.0 ml/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase was 860 units/L.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. What does that all mean?\nDoctor: Based on these results, we performed a bone marrow biopsy, which revealed a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. The biopsy showed marked hypercellularity (99%) with profound myeloid hyperplasia and complete maturation to segmented neutrophils. Immature myeloid cells of all stages were appropriately present, without dysplasia or increased blasts. A moderate amount of reticulin fibrosis was seen.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: Additionally, Giemsa stain of the aspirate confirmed the biopsy findings with a blast count of less than 5%. By flow cytometric analysis, myeloid cells in the blast gate expressing CD34 accounted for less than 1% of total cells. Molecular diagnostic testing of the aspirate indicated the presence of the BCL-ABL1 p210-type transcript by RT-PCR with an international scale-normalized (ISN) copy number of 35.27%. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) testing for BCR-ABL1 fusion was present in 89% of cells. Together, these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chronic phase-CML.\nPatient: So I have chronic phase-CML?\nDoctor: Yes, that's correct. Considering your symptoms of intermittent dyspnea in the absence of anemia, we conducted further evaluation. A stress echocardiogram indicated a normal left ventricular ejection fraction.\nPatient: That's good, I guess.\nDoctor: We also performed a computed tomography (CT) chest with contrast enhancement, which revealed mediastinal, cervical, and supraclavicular adenopathy, without evidence of pulmonary embolism.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: The next step is for you to undergo an excisional biopsy of the cervical adenopathy to further assess the situation and determine the best course of treatment.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll schedule the biopsy and keep you informed of the results and treatment options. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.\nPatient: Thanks, I appreciate it.",

I got pregnant naturally, and I have no family history of twins or multiple births. There haven't been any remarkable abnormalities in my medical history.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. We performed some fetal ultrasound scans on your pregnancy. The scans showed a monochorionic diamniotic pregnancy with imbalanced development of the twins. Twin 1 presented with normal development of the brain, abdomen, skeleton, and cardiovascular system. Twin 2 had a normal brain and abdomen, but there were some issues like an underdeveloped or absent radius, a ventricular septal defect, and a cleft lip and palate.\nPatient: Oh, that's concerning. What about the ultrasound parameters for both twins?\nDoctor: For Twin 1, the Biparietal diameter (BPD) was 59 mm, Head circumference (HC) was 223 mm, Abdominal circumference (AC) was 198 mm, Femur length (FL) was 45 mm, and Heart rate (HR) was 154/min.

What do you think could be the cause of the imbalanced development?\nDoctor: The data from the ultrasound examination indicated that the imbalanced development of the two fetuses might be due to Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), but we can't exclude the possibility of chromosomal abnormalities.\nPatient: What are the next steps then?\nDoctor: After discussing with our genetic counseling team, we recommend that you and your partner consider a diagnostic amniocentesis for the normal fetus, Twin 1. This will help us determine if there are any chromosomal abnormalities.\nPatient: Okay, we agreed to do the amniocentesis. What will be done with the amniotic cells?\nDoctor: The amniotic cells will be cultured in CHANG Medium for 7-10 days for karyotyping and Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) analysis. Conventional G-banded karyotyping will be performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes and cord blood according to standard protocols. We will use Agilent's commercial arrays for the aCGH analysis and the data will be analyzed with AgilentGen.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything.

I don't have any positive family history of breast cancer.\nDoctor: I see. Let me check your records. It looks like you had a right sonomammography performed at the Radiology Department, UCH, using a Logiq P5 GE ultrasound machine with a high frequency linear transducer. At your first presentation, they found a poorly circumscribed mixed echogenic mass at the 12 o'clock position, measuring 4.9 × 3.2 cm. The mass had specks of calcifications within it and Doppler interrogation showed evidence of increased vascularity. They assigned a final BI-RADS category of 4, which is suspicious for malignancy. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: After that, conventional mammography was performed and confirmed a poorly defined mass with microcalcifications and architectural distortion at the 12 o'clock position.

Can you please tell me a bit about your medical history?\nPatient: Sure. I have arterial hypertension and calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition (CPDD) disease, which I manage with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. I don't have any medical family history, and I've never had any surgical interventions. Oh, and about 6 months ago, I had infective endocarditis due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but that was successfully treated with medical treatment.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. How was the infective endocarditis diagnosed?\nPatient: It was diagnosed by suggestive findings on a transesophageal echocardiogram and isolation of MRSA on two consecutive blood cultures.\nDoctor: I understand. Did you require any operative treatment for your infective endocarditis?\nPatient: No, because I had moderate aortic and mitral regurgitation, the cardiothoracic surgery team said that no operative treatment was necessary.\nDoctor: What was the medical treatment you received for the infective endocarditis?\nPatient: I was given intravenously administered antibiotics using a combination of vancomycin at 30 mg/kg per day for 8 weeks and gentamicin at 3 mg/kg per day for 5 days.\nDoctor: Thank you. And how did you respond to the treatment?\nPatient: I became afebrile from the third week of antibiotherapy, and my C-reactive protein (CRP) was negative at the last week of antibiotherapy.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Now, at the current presentation, I noticed during the physical examination that you have a painful and tender swelling over your right sternoclavicular joint (SCJ), and the overlying skin is stretched and shiny. Your rectal temperature is 39 °C, and there's a moderate decrease in your right shoulder's range of motion. Your cardiac auscultation doesn't reveal any added sounds or abnormalities. We also conducted laboratory investigations that showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 107 mm at the end of 1 hour, and a CRP at 222 mg/l.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: We also performed computed tomography (CT) scans that revealed destruction of the medial extremities of your two clavicles and bilateral collections in the soft tissues around the SCJs. Magnetic resonance imaging will be necessary for further evaluation.\nPatient: What should I do now, doctor?\nDoctor: We will continue to monitor your condition closely and discuss the appropriate course of action based on the results of the magnetic resonance imaging. Please follow up with us regularly and let us know if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any new symptoms.\nPatient: Okay, thank you for helping me, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Let me perform a physical examination to assess the situation. Alright, I can feel a 7 x 6 cm firm irregular subcutaneous mass in the right lower para-umbilical area of your anterior abdominal wall. Your vital signs are normal, and on palpation, your abdomen is soft and lax with no intra-abdominal masses. There are no palpable lymph nodes, and your cardiac and respiratory examinations are unremarkable. We'll need to perform a Computerized Tomography (CT) scan to get a better understanding of the mass.\nPatient: Okay, thank you.\n[After CT scan]\nDoctor: The CT scan has revealed a mass within your abdominal wall. Your laboratory investigations are within normal limits, and your chest X-ray is unremarkable. We'll have to perform a wide local excision with safety margins to remove the tumor.\nPatient: Alright, if that's what's needed.\n[After surgery]\nDoctor: The surgery went well, and the postoperative period was uneventful. You'll be discharged on the second postoperative day in a satisfactory condition.\nPatient: That's great to hear. Thank you, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. Upon examining the excised specimen, we found an ellipse of skin measuring 13 x 10 cm with subcutaneous fatty tissue measuring 11 cm in thickness. The cut section revealed a well-defined nonencapsulated grayish-yellow mass measuring 7 x 6 cm with foci of necrosis. No skin infiltration or abdominal skeletal muscle involvement was noted.\nPatient: Hmm, what does the microscopic examination show?\nDoctor: The microscopic examination revealed a well-defined but nonencapsulated subcutaneous mesenchymal neoplasm composed of irregular islands of large cells. These cells have mostly round to oval pleomorphic vesicular nuclei, with markedly granular cytoplasm and several large eosinophilic globules. The nuclear cytoplasmic ratio was variable, with several cells having large nuclei. The tumor nests were surrounded by bands of fibrous connective tissue.\nPatient: Were there any signs of tumor necrosis?\nDoctor: Yes, there were many foci of tumor necrosis and scattered mitotic figures, 4 per 10 HPF at a magnification of 200. The margins of resection were free of the tumor.\nPatient: What about the Immunohistochemical stains?\nDoctor: The Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for vimentin, S100, and CD68. Stains for cytokeratin (CK), smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin, and myogenin were negative, which gives us more information about the tumor's nature.\nPatient: Alright, thank you so much for all your help, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome!

We then changed your antibiotic regimen to piperacillin/tazobactam, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim with prednisone, and fluconazole.\nPatient: Okay, I see. So, what's next?\nDoctor: We performed repeat HIV serology, which was negative. Your laboratory results showed panhypogammaglobulinemia and low total B- and CD4 T-cells. We have initiated IV immunoglobulin (IG) treatment at 400 mg/kg every 3-4 weeks to help improve your immune system.\nPatient: What about my thymoma? Can you do anything about that?\nDoctor: We evaluated you for a possible thymectomy, but unfortunately, due to your clinical condition, you are not currently a surgical candidate.\nPatient: I see. Anything else we can do?\nDoctor: At this point, we will continue to monitor your condition closely and adjust your treatment as needed. However, I must inform you that your clinical status has continued to deteriorate.\nPatient: I understand, doc.

He reports a recent history of Bordetella bronchiseptica pneumonia and empyema treated with IV antibiotics and right pleural decortication, followed by recurrent pneumonia and hypoxic respiratory failure. The patient describes persistent respiratory distress despite treatment.\nO: Physical examination revealed fever, hypoxia, tachycardia, and oral candidiasis. Lung auscultation showed coarse, mechanical breath sounds bilaterally. Chest radiography indicated bilateral patchy airspace opacities, and CT scan displayed a stable large anterior mediastinal mass, multiple cavitary lesions, and diffuse ground-glass opacities. Bronchoalveolar lavage identified B. bronchiseptica and Pneumocystis jirovecii. Laboratory results showed panhypogammaglobulinemia and low total B- and CD4 T-cells. HIV serology was negative.\nA: The primary diagnosis is recurrent pneumonia complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure, with superimposed Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and oral candidiasis. The patient's immunocompromised state is evidenced by panhypogammaglobulinemia and low lymphocyte counts. The presence of a stable thymoma contributes to his complex clinical picture, though he is not a candidate for surgical intervention due to his deteriorating condition.\nP: The management plan includes continuation of broad-spectrum IV antibiotics (piperacillin/tazobactam), antifungal treatment with fluconazole, and antipneumocystis therapy with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and prednisone. Initiation of IV immunoglobulin treatment at 400 mg/kg every 3-4 weeks is aimed at improving immune function. Close monitoring of his respiratory and immune status will be necessary, with adjustments to treatment as indicated by clinical and laboratory findings.

Have you ever experienced any falling incidents?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any history of falling, but I did experience some unsteadiness when turning around.\nDoctor: I see. That might possibly be due to the 4 cm difference in your leg lengths, which is secondary to a congenital vascular malformation in one of your legs that impacted its growth. Let's move on to your examination results. Your blood pressure was 107/68 mmHg, and your heart rate was 55 bpm. Your BMI is 26.5. During the finger-to-nose touching test, there was no sign of tremor. However, you had some mild balance problems while turning and showed instability on tandem walking during the first few steps.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, the pain has been getting worse, and I've been experiencing constant nausea and vomiting. It's been really hard for me to deal with all this.\nDoctor: I understand. Your medical records mention that you had a cholecystectomy two years ago for intermittent epigastric pain. At that time, a CT abdomen revealed a mass measuring 5.4 x 5.0 cm. It was subsequently diagnosed as a bronchogenic cyst after an EUS. You had an EBUS guided aspiration, and you were discharged after partial improvement. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Based on your current physical examination, your heart rate is 126/min, which is above the normal range of 60-100/min, and respiratory rate is 20/min, at the upper end of the normal range of 12-20/min. Your initial labs showed a white cell count of 10.58 x 10^3/uL, which is within the normal range, but you have elevated inflammatory markers, such as an ESR of 63 mm/hr and a CRP of 116 mg/L.

The X-ray and CT findings suggest that you may have a partial cyst rupture or an infected cyst. We performed an X-ray esophagogram, which ruled out esophageal compression or contrast extravasation.\nPatient: So what can be done to help with my symptoms?\nDoctor: Your symptoms have been refractory to conservative analgesic and antiemetic measures like Dilaudid (hydromorphone) 1 mg IV every 3 hours and Zofran (Ondansetron) 4 mg IV every 4 hours for pain and nausea/vomiting, respectively. We consulted cardiothoracic surgery, and they recommended surgical intervention.\nPatient: What does the surgery involve?\nDoctor: The patient underwent a right thoracotomy and surgical cyst excision.

However, many patients do successfully recover from the surgery.\nPatient: I understand. What about other complications after the surgery?\nDoctor: Some patients may require pacemaker implantation due to post-operative sinus node dysfunction or atrioventricular conduction abnormalities. All patients are discharged on oral antiarrhythmic medication for 3-6 months and anticoagulants for 6 months. At discharge, most patients are in sinus rhythm, some have a stable pacemaker rhythm, and a few have atrial fibrillation or flutter.\nPatient: If I need a pacemaker, when would that happen?\nDoctor: In some cases, a patient may need a pacemaker implant a few months after the operation due to the presence of sinus node dysfunction.\nPatient: How can I expect to feel after the surgery?\nDoctor: During a median follow-up of 14 months, many patients show an improvement in their NYHA functional class. Some patients in NYHA class III progress to class II or even class I, while others in class II progress to class I.\nPatient: What about the recurrence of arrhythmia?\nDoctor: Recurrence of arrhythmia occurs in about 8.6% of patients more than 3 months after surgery. These patients usually have a history of atrial fibrillation and are treated with right-sided Maze rather than Cox maze III due to technical issues.\nPatient: And what about my electrocardiogram at follow-up?\nDoctor: At follow-up, most patients are in sinus rhythm, some have stable pacemaker rhythm, and a few have permanent atrial fibrillation.\nPatient: What about anti-arrhythmic therapy?\nDoctor: At a median follow-up of 14 months, about 69% of patients are in stable sinus rhythm, with 12 of them not requiring any anti-arrhythmic therapy.\nPatient: Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to help you through this process.",

Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Can you tell me about any recent falls you've had?\nPatient: I actually had a fall 5 days after I got a Watchman™ device placed.\nDoctor: I see. Your history of atrial fibrillation has been complicated with multiple episodes of syncope, despite various antiarrhythmic therapy strategies. You were previously on dabigatran, which caused severe bruising, and rivaroxaban, which gave you headaches. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's correct.\nDoctor: After discussing with your cardiologist, a Watchman™ device was placed given your high thrombotic risk and prior complications with oral antithrombotic therapy. Your CHADS2-VASC2 score is 6 and HAS-BLED score is 4. You were started on apixaban 5 mg twice daily, plus aspirin 81 mg daily for continuation for the following 45 days. However, you presented to the emergency room 5 days after the device placement with lethargy, fever, and hypotension. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: You were found to be in septic shock from methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia. Your hemodynamics and mental status initially improved in the intensive care unit (ICU) on vasopressors, stress dose steroids, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. These were subsequently narrowed to intravenous vancomycin. In addition, your apixaban was transitioned to intravenous unfractionated heparin upon presentation to the ICU. Is this all correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Despite hemodynamic improvement, your mental status worsened. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed multiple acute small punctuate infarcts in the left corona radiata, right occipital cortex, and right frontal deep white matter. These multifocal strokes were thought to be cardioembolic, not septic in origin. Did you miss any doses of apixaban after the device placement?\nPatient: Yes, I have to admit that I missed a few doses.\nDoctor: A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was obtained to further assess your condition. It's important to follow your medication regimen to avoid any complications. Moving forward, we will continue to monitor your progress and adjust your medications as needed. Please make sure to take your medications as prescribed and to report any further symptoms or issues.\nPatient: Okay, I'll make sure to follow the medication regimen and keep you updated.\nDoctor: Thank you. We'll work together to manage your condition and improve your health. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.",

Can you tell me what brought you in today?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been having some chest pain when I exert myself, like when I exercise or do something strenuous.\nDoctor: I see. Can you describe the chest pain for me?\nPatient: It's right in the middle of my chest and feels like pressure. It gets worse when I'm active and goes away when I rest.\nDoctor: Have you experienced any sweating or palpitations along with the chest pain?\nPatient: No, I haven't had any of those.\nDoctor: We performed an exercise stress test on you, and it showed inferior wall ischemic changes. We decided to bring you in for an elective angiogram to further investigate the issue. Upon admission, you were afebrile with a blood pressure of 147/85 mm/Hg and a regular heart rate of 79 beats/minute. Your ECG showed a sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block, but no ST segment or T wave changes indicative of ischemia. Your lab tests, including troponin, lipid profiles, and fasting blood glucose, were all within normal limits.\nPatient: Okay, so what happened during the angiogram?\nDoctor: We referred you to the catheterization lab for a coronary angiogram through the right femoral artery. Cannulation of the right coronary ostia revealed an anomalous origin of the left circumflex artery and the right coronary artery from a shared ostium. The right coronary artery had 80% stenosis in the middle and distal segments, and the right posterior descending artery had 70% stenosis in the proximal segment. The left circumflex artery, however, didn't show any significant stenosis.\nPatient: And what about the left coronary ostia?\nDoctor: While looking for the left coronary ostia, we discovered the anomalous origin of the left anterior descending artery from the right coronary cusp. It arose just anterior to the shared ostium of the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery, but it didn't have any stenosis.\nPatient: So, what's the next step?\nDoctor: We decided to abort the procedure to perform a cardiac multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) to further study the anatomy of your coronary arteries. This will help us determine the best course of action for your treatment.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I'll await the results of the MDCT and the next steps.",

I've been having trouble breathing, especially when I try to do any activity.\nDoctor: I understand. Your brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level is elevated at >900, which indicates that you might have severe AS. Due to your high surgical risk (the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score of 9.8%), you've been referred to our institution for treatment.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me, doctor?\nDoctor: We performed a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and found that you have not only severe AS (aortic valve area of 0.58 cm2 and peak velocity of 4.0 m/s), but also diffuse left ventricular hypertrophy, except in the posterior wall, which is a Maron type III hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. You also have LVOT obstruction with systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve, leading to moderate mitral regurgitation (MR).\nPatient: That sounds quite serious.\nDoctor: Yes, it is. During a Valsalva maneuver, your peak velocity was 2.9 m/s, and the mean pressure gradient was 32 mmHg at the LVOT. After administering a beta-blocker (bisoprolol 1.25 mg/day), the LVOT obstruction and SAM disappeared, and MR was reduced to a mild degree. However, your peak velocity across the aortic valve and BNP level remain high, so we've planned a TAVI to treat your AS.\nPatient: What does that involve?\nDoctor: Coronary angiography confirmed the first major septal branch perfusing the basal septum. We'll consider ASA as a rescue option for recurrence of LVOT obstruction. We'll implant a 23 mm SAPIEN 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) via transfemoral approach with general anesthesia and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) guidance, under continuous infusion of a beta-blocker (landiolol) and volume load.\nPatient: Okay, and what happens after that?\nDoctor: Five minutes after implantation, we'll check for any LVOT obstruction and SAM. In your case, there was no obvious LVOT obstruction and SAM after 5 minutes. However, 15 minutes later, TEE showed SAM and severe MR, and the pressure gradient was >50 mmHg at the LVOT, even under increased doses of beta-blockers.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Your hemodynamic status became rapidly unstable, so we decided to perform an emergent ASA. We'll use a 2 mm over-the-wire balloon and microbubble to help stabilize your condition.\nPatient: I understand. Thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.\nDoctor: You're welcome. We'll do everything we can to ensure the best possible outcome for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.",

How are you feeling now?\nPatient: Yeah, I was in so much pain, but it's much better now, thanks.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We performed a CT scan of your abdomen and found bilateral renal masses: 2.4 cm on the right and 7.6 cm on the left. We also saw multiple small cysts in your lung bases.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Your abdominal pain has resolved with conservative management alone, which is a good sign. We referred you to urology, and they recommended resecting your left kidney tumor and deferring the right one pending pathology results. Do you have any prior medical history or relevant surgical history?\nPatient: No, I've been healthy and well. I don't have any medical history or surgeries.\nDoctor: That's good to know. Do any of your family members have lung, skin, or kidney symptoms?\nPatient: No, my siblings, parents, and my 15-year-old son are all healthy.\nDoctor: Great. We didn't find any consistent skin findings on your exam. We also conducted a pulmonary evaluation with a CT of your chest, which identified basilar predominant multiple lung cysts, with the largest one measuring approximately 1.6 cm. There were several partially solid nodules less than 6 mm as well. Your spirometry, diffusion capacity, and plethysmography were all within normal limits.\nPatient: Oh, okay. But I've been having some mild breathing problems lately.\nDoctor: That could be related to the cysts. You mentioned intermittent dyspnea and a significant anxiety component. We'll keep an eye on that. You eventually underwent resection of your left kidney mass with a partial nephrectomy. The pathologic diagnosis is an oncocytoma, which is a typical tumor type for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Your postoperative course was unremarkable, and we have a planned sequential right nephrectomy pending further evaluation.\nPatient: So, do I have this Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome?\nDoctor: We suspected Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome given your lung cysts and bilateral renal masses, but without skin findings, the diagnosis was uncertain. There are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria, but typically, skin findings or a pathologic mutation must accompany the lung and kidney pathology to confirm the diagnosis. We performed genetic testing via a blood sample and sequenced your FLCN gene to look for any deletions or duplications.\nPatient: What were the results of the genetic test?\nDoctor: We're still waiting for the results to come back. Once we have them, we'll have a clearer understanding of your condition and can discuss the next steps in your treatment plan.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.\nDoctor: Of course, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll be in touch once we have the genetic test results, and we'll discuss the best course of action going forward. Take care!",

Differential diagnoses include primary thyroid dysfunction and secondary cardiac effects. The elevated TSH and decreased fT4 suggest inadequate thyroid hormone replacement. The patient's CHA2DS2-VASc score of three indicates a moderate to high risk of stroke.\nP: Adjust the levothyroxine dosage based on thyroid function tests and continue monitoring thyroid levels. Initiate anticoagulation therapy to reduce stroke risk. Ensure the patient continues taking levothyroxine on an empty stomach one hour before breakfast. Schedule follow-ups with the cardiologist and primary care physician to manage atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Educate the patient to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath occur."

Have you had any other treatments for your RA besides the conventional DMARDs?\nPatient: Yes, in December 2008, I started taking ADA 40 mg every 2 weeks because the DMARDs weren't working well enough.\nDoctor: Hmm, I understand. Did you have any tests done before starting ADA treatment?\nPatient: Yes, I had a positive TST and my doctor had me take INH for 9 months as a precaution.\nDoctor: Good, that's a standard procedure for RA patients starting ADA therapy. How has the ADA treatment been working for you?\nPatient: It was effective against my RA, but in February 2010, I developed cellulitis on both legs.\nDoctor: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Were you able to get treatment for the cellulitis?\nPatient: Yes, it improved after taking antibiotics, specifically imipenem, and temporarily stopping ADA.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. Have you had any other issues since then?\nPatient: In May 2011, I had a slight fever and some blood tests showed elevated serum CRP and continuous elevation of neutrophil CD64.\nDoctor: I see. Did you undergo any further examination to find the cause of these symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, they did a chest X-ray and CT scan and found diffuse reticulonodular shadows in the lung fields, suggesting miliary TB.\nDoctor: That's concerning. Were there any other tests performed to confirm the diagnosis?\nPatient: They did a sputum PCR test and found acid-fast bacilli in smear preparations from my sputum and gastric juice. The test came back positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.\nDoctor: I understand. Were you transferred to a hospital for further treatment?\nPatient: Yes, I was transferred to a hospital with a TB ward.\nDoctor: Did they perform a bronchoscopy to examine your lungs?\nPatient: Yes, they found noncaseating epithelioid granuloma in the bronchial and alveolar specimens from the bronchoscopy.\nDoctor: Did they examine the cellulitis-like lesion on your right lower limb as well?\nPatient: Yes, they did a biopsy and found erythema induratum of Bazin.\nDoctor: It seems like you have been through a lot. How has your condition been since starting the anti-TB treatment?\nPatient: My levels of neutrophil CD64 decreased below the cutoff value, and I've seen improvement in my clinical manifestations.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. I recommend continuing to follow up with your doctors and keeping a close eye on your symptoms. If you notice any changes or worsening of your condition, please don't hesitate to come back for further evaluation.",

The patient developed cellulitis in both legs in February 2010, which improved with imipenem and temporary cessation of ADA. In May 2011, the patient experienced a slight fever and elevated serum CRP and neutrophil CD64 levels. Subsequent investigations revealed miliary tuberculosis (TB), confirmed by sputum PCR and bronchoscopy, which showed noncaseating epithelioid granuloma. The patient also had erythema induratum of Bazin on the right lower limb.\nO: The patient's ADA treatment was effective against RA but led to complications including cellulitis and miliary TB. Laboratory tests showed elevated CRP and neutrophil CD64. Imaging and bronchoscopy confirmed miliary TB and noncaseating epithelioid granuloma. Biopsy of the right lower limb lesion confirmed erythema induratum of Bazin. The patient has been treated in a specialized TB ward and has shown clinical improvement with anti-TB treatment.\nA: Primary diagnosis is miliary tuberculosis secondary to immunosuppression from ADA therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Differential diagnoses included complications from RA and ADA therapy, such as cellulitis and erythema induratum of Bazin. The prognosis is cautiously optimistic with ongoing anti-TB treatment and monitoring.\nP: Continue anti-TB treatment and regular monitoring of TB symptoms and RA activity. Follow up with rheumatology for RA management and adjust immunosuppressive therapy as needed to balance control of RA symptoms with risk of opportunistic infections. Educate the patient on signs of potential complications, including worsening of respiratory symptoms or skin lesions. Ensure adherence to treatment and follow-up appointments with both rheumatology and infectious disease specialists."

Have you had any issues with tobacco abuse or depression?\nPatient: Yes, I have a history of tobacco abuse and depression.\nDoctor: I see. What brought you to the hospital today?\nPatient: I've been feeling really tired for the past three weeks, and I've been coughing up blood-tinged sputum for the past two days.\nDoctor: I'm sorry to hear that. We'll conduct a physical examination. *After examination* I noticed decreased breath sounds on your right lung base, but your oral cavity looks normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy.\nPatient: Hmm, okay.\nDoctor: We've done an initial laboratory evaluation, and it came back normal. There was no leukocytosis, and your blood cultures were negative. Your Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) test was also non-reactive.\nPatient: That's good to hear.\nDoctor: However, your chest radiograph revealed a large, lower, right-sided loculated effusion. We performed an ultrasound-guided chest tube placement, which yielded 200 ml of exudative fluid with 34,300/mm3 nucleated white blood cells and 1372/mm3 granulocytes.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: That means there's an infection in your lung. We sent the pleural fluid for laboratory analysis and started you on intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam. The pleural fluid culture showed a rare species, S. gordonii, causing the infection.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: During your stay at the hospital, we noticed you have mild dysphagia with your regular diet. Aspiration may be the reason for your infection.\nPatient: So, what's next?\nDoctor: We did a repeat chest X-ray, which showed worsening empyema. We administered tPA in the chest tube, which yielded 550 cc of exudative fluid. A follow-up CT of your chest revealed loculated effusions.\nPatient: Is there anything else we can do?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, the chest tube drainage with tPA and antibiotics didn't improve the loculated effusions. We're going to transfer you to a more advanced center for video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) decortication.\nPatient: Alright, I hope that helps. Thank you, doctor.",
    "soap": "S: The patient, a known smoker with a history of depression, reports experiencing significant fatigue for the past three weeks and coughing up blood-tinged sputum for the past two days. He also mentions mild dysphagia with his regular diet.\nO: Physical examination revealed decreased breath sounds at the right lung base. Initial labs including leukocyte count and blood cultures were normal. HIV test was non-reactive. Chest radiograph and subsequent CT showed a large, right-sided loculated effusion. Ultrasound-guided chest tube placement extracted 200 ml of exudative fluid with high levels of nucleated white cells and granulocytes. Pleural fluid culture isolated S. gordonii. Repeat chest X-ray indicated worsening empyema despite treatment with intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam and tPA administration through the chest tube, which yielded 550 cc of exudative fluid.\nA: The primary diagnosis is empyema secondary to aspiration, likely exacerbated by the patient's history of tobacco use and dysphagia. The identification of S. gordonii in the pleural fluid is notable, as this is a rare causative agent. The lack of response to conservative management including antibiotics and chest tube drainage with tPA suggests a complicated course.\nP: The patient will be transferred to a specialized center for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) decortication to address the loculated effusions. Continuation of antibiotic therapy tailored to the culture results is recommended. Nutritional assessment and modification of diet to manage dysphagia, along with smoking cessation counseling, are also advised to prevent recurrence and improve overall lung health.

Can you tell me about your experience with hemodialysis?\nPatient: Yeah, I have been undergoing hemodialysis for the past 4 years.\nDoctor: I see. Now, you received a living-related renal transplant from your husband in September 2014, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Before the transplantation, we performed a computed tomography (CT) scan which revealed moderate to severe atherosclerosis of the bilateral iliac arteries. Did you know about this?\nPatient: Yes, I was informed about that.\nDoctor: And we also found that the donor's CT revealed two left renal arteries. Your blood type is compatible, but you had donor-specific antibody-positive. So, we performed desensitization before transplantation with three sessions of double filtration plasmapheresis or plasma exchange and two doses of rituximab (100 mg). Were you aware of this?\nPatient: Yes, I remember going through that process.\nDoctor: Good. For your immunosuppressive agents, we included triple immunosuppressive therapy with extended-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and methylprednisolone. Are you still taking these medications?\nPatient: Yes, I am.\nDoctor: During the transplant, we made the transplant bed in the right iliac fossa. There were two donor renal arteries, the main artery and one narrow artery. To extend the length of the narrow artery, we used the donor's gonadal vein graft with end-to-end anastomosis using a 6-0 monofilament at the back table. Were you aware of this?\nPatient: I think I heard something about that, but I didn't quite understand it.\nDoctor: That's okay. Usually, when there are two donor renal arteries, we connect the two arteries conjointly or side-to-end at the back table. However, due to the short length and large distance between the two arteries, we decided to intracorporeally anastomose each renal artery to the iliac artery to avoid anastomotic stenosis. The transplanted renal vein was anastomosed to the right external iliac vein side-to-end using a 5-0 monofilament with continuous sutures.\nPatient: Okay, I see.\nDoctor: First, considering the position of the two arteries, we decided to anastomose the extended artery to the right external iliac artery side-to-end using a 6-0 monofilament with continuous sutures. Second, before anastomosing the main artery to the iliac artery, we punched out the external iliac artery using an aorta.\nPatient: Alright, I understand better now.\nDoctor: Great. It's important to keep up with your follow-up appointments and continue taking your immunosuppressive medications as prescribed. Do you have any questions or concerns?\nPatient: No, I think I understand everything now. Thank you for explaining it to me.\nDoctor: You're welcome. If you have any questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Take care!\nPatient: Thank you, doctor!",

Can you tell me when you first started experiencing these symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, the initial symptoms appeared about 20 years ago. It was primarily a kinetic tremor in my left upper and lower limbs.\nDoctor: I see. During the neurological examination, it was noted that you presented with dysarthria, paresis of the right facial nerve, brisk reflexes on the right side, bilateral dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesis, truncal ataxia, and ataxia of the lower limbs, which was more prominent on the left side. You also had an unstable gait. Did you notice any of these issues before?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been struggling with some of those problems for a while now.\nDoctor: A psychological examination also revealed mild cognitive impairment and deficits in executive functions. Were you aware of these issues?\nPatient: I've noticed some trouble with my memory and thinking, but I wasn't sure what it was.\nDoctor: Your combination of intention tremor, ataxia, the MCP sign, and gait instability led us to suspect FXTAS. We performed an extended molecular examination using the Amplide X FMR1 PCR kit, which revealed permutations in the FMR1 gene (between 60 and 85 ± 5 repeats of CGG). This confirmed the diagnosis of FXTAS with the expansion of CGG repeats in your FMR1 gene.\nPatient: Oh, I see. What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Well, we tried pharmacological treatments such as primidone and propranolol to treat your tremors, but they didn't have sufficient effects. So, we performed a radiosurgical thalamotomy using the GK on the VIM of your left thalamus.\nPatient: How did you do that?\nDoctor: We attached the Leksell Model G stereotactic coordinate frame to your head and acquired high-resolution MRI images using a 1.5T scanner. Contrast-enhanced T1 and T2 images were taken at 1 mm intervals. We identified the anterior commissure (AC), the posterior commissure (PC), and the third ventricle on these images.\nPatient: And then what happened?\nDoctor: Stereotactic radiosurgical thalamotomy was performed using the Leksell Gamma Knife Perfexion model.

    "soap": "S: The patient, with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and stroke, presents with a chief complaint of muscle weakness for the past two months. The patient also reported a remote exposure to statins.\nO: Physical examination revealed muscle strength of 2/5 on the left side and 4/5 on the right. Laboratory tests showed an extremely high creatine kinase (CK) level at 28,885 U/L (normal range: 22-198 U/L). MRI indicated extensive proximal muscle edema. Muscle biopsy of the vastus medialis displayed necrotizing features without inflammation. Hydroxy-Methyl-Glutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG CoA) antibodies were strongly positive. Follow-up over several months showed fluctuating CK levels with a peak at 28,885 U/L and a decrease to 117 U/L after treatment. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was 251 U/L (normal range: 135-225 U/L).\nA: The primary diagnosis is necrotizing myositis, likely statin-induced given the history and strong positivity for HMG CoA antibodies. The differential diagnosis initially included other forms of myositis, but biopsy results supported the primary diagnosis. The patient's condition showed a response to immunosuppressive therapy, although with some fluctuations in muscle strength and CK levels.\nP: Initiated treatment with IV methylprednisolone followed by oral prednisone (PDN) 60 mg/day. Added mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 1 g/day and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Due to persistent symptoms and elevated CK levels, rituximab and increased doses of MMF (3 g/day) and PDN were introduced. Tacrolimus (TAC) was added later, starting at 4 mg/day and increased to 6 mg/day, with a gradual tapering of PDN to 5 mg/day. The patient showed marked improvement after eight months of TAC treatment. Continued monitoring and regular follow-up appointments are recommended to manage and adjust the treatment regimen as needed."

    "dialogue": "Doctor: Hi, I see that you were admitted to our hospital in March 2017 for a liver resection to treat a malignant hepatic lesion. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right, doc.\nDoctor: It looks like this hepatic lesion was diagnosed through CT and PET scans, and a fine-needle biopsy came back positive for squamous carcinoma. Do you recall any symptoms that led to these tests?\nPatient: Well, they found the hepatic tumor during a follow-up for my bladder cancer. I had endoscopic surgery for that three years ago.\nDoctor: I see. The hepatic tumor measured 22 mm in diameter and was located in the VIII Couinaud's segment of the liver. There were also three smaller hypodense liver lesions and a focal dilatation of the peripheral biliary tree. Our team of radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists discussed your case extensively. Even if the lesion had been the single site of disease, due to the proximity and doubtful infiltration of the lesion to the biliary tree, we decided to submit you to an explorative staging laparotomy and possible palliative surgery. Does that sound familiar?\nPatient: Yes, I remember that.\nDoctor: Our internal protocol states that during the preadmission, every patient who is a candidate for a liver resection is subjected to a routine liver function test with ICG to determine the most appropriate surgical procedures. In your case, 45 mg of ICG was intravenously administered to test hepatic function ten days before the surgery. Your ICG retention rate at 15 minutes (R15) was 8.9. \nPatient: Okay, I remember that test.\nDoctor: The ICG has a unique property of being fluorescent with the light emitted from the photodynamic eye of the laparoscopic system, allowing us to visualize the lesion during the surgical procedure. The timing of administration and dose of ICG are key points in this process.\nPatient: I see.\nDoctor: Studies have demonstrated that the effective dose of ICG depends on the timing of the injection. Specifically, if the liver function test had been performed more than 7 days before surgery, it would have been necessary to administer an adjunctive dose (0.1 mg/kg) the day before. In your case, we needed to administer an additional dose of ICG the day before your surgery.\nPatient: Oh, I remember getting that extra dose.\nDoctor: Good. Now that we've covered your previous treatment, let's discuss your follow-up requirements and any concerns you may have.\nPatient: Sure, doc. Thanks for explaining everything to me.",

The patient recalls undergoing various diagnostic tests, including CT, PET scans, and a fine-needle biopsy, which confirmed squamous carcinoma. Symptoms leading to these tests were not specified but were related to routine follow-up for previous bladder cancer.\nO: The hepatic tumor was 22 mm in diameter, located in the VIII Couinaud's segment of the liver, with additional findings of three smaller hypodense liver lesions and focal dilatation of the peripheral biliary tree. Pre-surgical assessment included a liver function test using 45 mg of intravenous ICG, with an ICG retention rate at 15 minutes (R15) of 8.9, indicating adequate liver function. An additional dose of ICG was administered the day before surgery due to the timing of the initial dose.\nA: Primary diagnosis was squamous carcinoma of the liver, with a history of bladder cancer. The hepatic lesion's proximity to the biliary tree raised concerns about possible infiltration, leading to explorative staging laparotomy and palliative surgery. Differential diagnoses included potential metastasis from previously treated bladder cancer.\nP: The patient will continue with routine follow-up to monitor for recurrence or progression of hepatic or bladder cancer.

Do you have any history of joint pain or other medical issues?\nPatient: I've had unclassified arthralgia for about 10 years.\nDoctor: Alright, thank you for sharing that. We've done some tests, and your creatinine level is quite high at 682 μmol/L. Your Urinalysis also showed 3+ blood and protein. We did a urine microscopy which revealed granular casts and more than 200 red cells per cubic millimeter. Your urinary protein to creatinine ratio is 133 mg/mmol. \nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Additionally, your physical examination was unremarkable, but your blood pressure was quite high at 186/74 upon admission. We also found a positive MPO-ANCA titre of 60 IU/ml and a positive anti-GBM titre of 33 IU/ml.\nPatient: What does that mean, exactly?\nDoctor: These results indicate that you have an autoimmune condition affecting your kidneys. Your complement levels, however, are normal. We performed a renal biopsy which revealed crescentic glomerulonephritis in 80% of your glomeruli. We didn't find any glomerular deposition of immunoglobulin or complement in the formalin fixed tissue sample.\nPatient: So, what's the plan for treatment?\nDoctor: We've started you on plasma exchange, pulsed methylprednisolone, followed by oral prednisolone and six pulses of intravenous cyclophosphamide. For maintenance therapy, we will give you a reducing course of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil, as you're intolerant to azathioprine.\nPatient: How long will I be on these medications?\nDoctor: We will monitor your progress closely. At 21 months of follow-up, your serum creatinine level has improved to 127 μmol/L, and both your MPO-ANCA and anti-GBM titres are negative.

Can you tell me about your symptoms and when they started?\nPatient: Hi, doc. About two weeks ago, I was cleaning out a cabin and got exposed to bank voles. Six days after that, I started feeling ill with fever, chills, weakness, and had difficulties eating and drinking. My urine production also decreased.\nDoctor: I see. We ran some tests and found positive serology for Puumala virus, which confirms the HFRS diagnosis. Your laboratory tests taken the day before admission revealed thrombocytopenia with a platelet count of 48 × 10^9/L, impaired renal function with a creatinine level of 278 μmol/L, and leucocytosis with a white blood cell count of 14 × 10^9/L.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious.\nDoctor: Upon admission to the hospital, your platelet count had increased to 61 × 10^9/L and creatinine increased to 370 μmol/L, indicating clinical progression to the oliguric stage of HFRS. However, your platelet levels decreased to 12 × 10^9/L on days 8 to 9. Due to the high risk of spontaneous bleeding, we decided to transfuse platelets on days 8, 9, and 10.\nPatient: Yes, I remember those transfusions.\nDoctor: Despite the transfusions with three platelet units, you remained severely thrombocytopenic with platelet counts below 50 × 10^9/L during days 8 to 13. You also fulfilled the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) from day 8.\nPatient: That's concerning.\nDoctor: On day 13, after your last platelet transfusion and a platelet count of 27 × 10^9/L, you experienced abdominal pain that increased in severity during the evening. We performed an abdominal computed tomography (CT) which showed congestion and ischemia in the terminal ileum due to a thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) reaching up to the portal vein (PV).\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean?\nDoctor: The hematologist advised against thrombolysis, which is a treatment to dissolve blood clots, due to your thrombocytopenia in combination with a known mild VHF. We will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide the necessary treatments to manage your symptoms and prevent complications.\nPatient: I see. Thank you for explaining everything to me.

Can you describe your symptoms in more detail?\nPatient: Yeah, my bowel movements have been irregular lately, and I've been experiencing some discomfort.\nDoctor: I understand. We conducted an abdominal examination and a digital rectal examination, both of which were unremarkable. We also performed laboratory studies, including a full blood count and biochemistry, which came back normal. However, a colonoscopy study identified four abnormal lesions. Two of them were colonic subcentimetre polyps.\nPatient: Oh, that doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Don't worry too much yet. More distally in the mid-rectum, at 15 cm from the anal verge, there was a sizeable, villous polypoidal lesion. The biopsy showed it to be a tubulovillous adenoma (TVA) with low-grade dysplasia. It's not cancerous, but it could explain your symptoms.\nPatient: Hmm, what about the other lesion?\nDoctor: The other lesion was more proximal in the distal sigmoid colon at 25 cm. It appeared to be malignant-looking with a stricture. However, biopsy samples showed hyperplastic colonic mucosa with lamina propria fibrosis and mild chronic active inflammation. There were also separate pieces of granulation tissue and ulcer slough, but no evidence of malignancy.\nPatient: So, it's not cancerous either?\nDoctor: As per our local protocol for malignant-appearing lesions on endoscopy, we arranged a staging CT scan based on the colonoscopy appearances to facilitate the cancer pathway. The CT scan demonstrated, at the site of the presumed malignancy in the distal sigmoid colon, a 7 cm segment of circumferential thickening on a background of diverticulosis. There were also a few subcentimetre locoregional and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. No other signs of malignancy were found, so the proposed CT staging was T2/3 N1 M0.\nPatient: What does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Although the 5 cm rectal TVA could explain your symptoms, our multidisciplinary team discussed your case and concluded that either lesion could be responsible for your symptoms. Despite the lack of malignant cells in the biopsy samples, the surgical team is still concerned about a potential sigmoid colon malignancy based on the endoscopy and CT appearances. We believe the colonoscopy sampling may not have been truly representative of the malignant-appearing sigmoid colon lesion seen at colonoscopy and CT.\nPatient: What's the next step then?\nDoctor: We have planned an anterior resection for you to remove both the TVA and the potential malignant lesion in the sigmoid colon. This will help us to ensure that we address both possible causes of your symptoms and rule out any malignancy.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me. I appreciate it.",

Let's go over your medical history. You were diagnosed with stage IIIB, BRAF-negative melanoma of the upper back and left axillary lymph node involvement in 2012. You were treated with wide local excision, which showed a Breslow thickness of 2.9 mm, and axillary lymph node dissection. You also received adjuvant therapy with a GM-CSF secreting allogeneic melanoma cell vaccine for 3 years. Is that correct?\nPatient 1: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: In 2015, you developed recurrent disease at the right buttock, inguinal nodes, and lung. You were then treated with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy and received a total of 25 doses. Your melanoma showed a complete response to the therapy, according to RECIST 1.1 v.5.0. However, after 20 doses, you started experiencing acute back pain. A contrast-enhanced MRI of the full spine demonstrated multiple non-traumatic vertebral compression fractures, rib fractures, and pelvic fractures, but no bone metastases. Is that correct?\nPatient 1: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: We continued your pembrolizumab therapy, but you developed additional compression fractures and more profound vertebral wedging, as seen in Fig. This prompted the discontinuation of pembrolizumab after 18 months of therapy. Your biochemical workup was unremarkable. However, your degree of active bone resorption, as measured by C-telopeptide levels, were elevated despite three weeks of alendronate use prior to your appointment. Is that correct?\nPatient 1: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your bone density at the hip showed osteopenia only, as lumbar spine was excluded due to the fracture. The histomorphometry from your transiliac bone biopsy revealed increased bone resorption, osteoclast surface, and reduced trabecular and cortical parameters, indicating bone loss. Since your bone loss continued on oral bisphosphonate, we decided to give you one infusion of intravenous bisphosphonate, specifically zoledronic acid. You also underwent multiple kyphoplasty procedures and permanently discontinued pembrolizumab. At present, your melanoma is in complete remission, 35 months after the commencement of pembrolizumab. How are you feeling now, in terms of your back pain?\nPatient 1: My back pain has improved a bit after the kyphoplasty procedures.\nDoctor: That's good to hear. We will continue to monitor your progress and ensure that your melanoma remains in complete remission.

It was red and swollen.\nDoctor: I see. It looks like you were examined by a dermatologist, who applied a simple wound dressing and discharged you with a prescription for regular oral antibiotics. How has the wound been since then?\nPatient: Well, a week later, the swelling and redness got worse, and there was pus-like discharge. That's when I came back to the hospital.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. We took Radiographs of your hand and found a visible tooth mark at the third metacarpal head. Your body temperature was also 38.5 °C, and laboratory tests showed an increased number of white blood cells (12.00 × 109/L) and elevated C-reactive protein (25.00 mg/L).

We quickly performed wound exploration in the operation room and found a partial lesion of the extensor and the second metacarpal head due to the bite and infection. An intraoperative Gram-stain wound culture was also done, but it didn't reveal any bacteria, likely because of the initial antibiotic treatment you received.\nPatient: So, what did you do next?\nDoctor: We performed surgical debridement three times and gave you intravenous systematic antibiotic therapy to completely resolve the osteomyelitis. However, the repeated debridements left a large defect in your third extensor and third metacarpal head, which measured 18 × 15 mm.\nPatient: That's why my finger is so painful and I can't move it, right?\nDoctor: Yes, exactly.

Did you experience any other symptoms? Perhaps sweatiness, dyspnea, or fever?\nPatient: Yes, I felt a bit sweaty, but I didn't have any trouble breathing or a fever.\nDoctor: Alright. When you arrived at the ED, you seemed alert and not in pain or distress. Upon examination, we found that you were tachycardic, but your blood pressure was normal. Your lungs also had clear air entry. We performed an ECG and discovered that you have SVT.\nPatient: Oh, okay. What does that mean?\nDoctor: SVT stands for supraventricular tachycardia. It's a condition where your heart beats faster than normal. We performed a head down deep breathing maneuver to help convert your heart back to a normal sinus rhythm. Fortunately, there were no complications from the procedure.\nPatient: That's good to hear. What about my blood pressure after the maneuver?\nDoctor: Your blood pressure was 131/73, which is within the normal range. We also checked your initial serum Troponin T levels, which were 10 ng/L. The normal lab range is 0-29 ng/L.\nPatient: So, my Troponin T levels are normal then?\nDoctor: Yes, they are within the normal range. However, given the earlier presence of chest pain and your cardiovascular risk factors, we decided to admit you to cardiology for observation.\nPatient: I understand.

It's especially painful on the lateral side.\nDoctor: I see. Have you noticed any restrictions in your movement or any other symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've noticed that my knee extension is limited. It's restricted to about 10 degrees.\nDoctor: Okay, let's perform a physical examination to understand the issue better. I'm going to perform the McMurray test. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.\nPatient: Hmm, I feel some discomfort during the test.\nDoctor: It seems that the McMurray test is positive, but there's no instability. We will need to conduct some imaging tests to get more information. Let's start with an X-ray.\nPatient: Alright, doctor.\n(After the X-ray)\nDoctor: The X-ray findings show no remarkable issues. However, to get a clearer picture, let's do an MRI.\nPatient: Okay, sure.\n(After the MRI)\nDoctor: The MRI results show that the DLM has a horizontal high signal cleavage. Based on this, I recommend that you undergo surgery followed by postoperative therapy, similar to a previous case I've handled.\nPatient: I understand, doctor. I'm willing to go through with the surgery and therapy.\n(After two years)\nDoctor: How have you been feeling since the surgery?\nPatient: I've been great, doctor! I have no symptoms while running, and my range of motion is back to normal.\nDoctor: That's excellent to hear. I just reviewed your recent X-ray, and it shows a slight narrowing of the lateral joint space. The MRI also shows a thin lateral meniscus that has maintained its width at 12.1 mm with no progression of coronal or sagittal extrusion.\nPatient: That's a relief.

It's really bothering me.\nDoctor: I see. Can you tell me about your past medical history and any previous surgeries you've had?\nPatient: Yes, I have hypertension. I also had a thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer and a Caesarean section in the past.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. Given your symptoms, I'd like to perform a contrast-enhanced CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a better understanding of your condition. Is that okay with you?\nPatient: Sure, let's do it.\n(After the CT scan)\nDoctor: The CT scan shows multiple fluid-filled, dilated small bowel loops in your right abdomen. We've identified two transition points in the right lower quadrant, one at the distal ileum and another in the proximal ileum. These findings are indicative of a closed loop obstruction. There's also decreased wall enhancement of the dilated small bowel loops, which is concerning for ischemia.\nPatient: Oh no, what does that mean?\nDoctor: Ischemia means that there's a lack of blood supply to that area, which can be dangerous. Given your symptoms and the findings on the CT scan, we need to take you to the operating room for further examination and treatment.\nPatient: Okay, I understand.\n(In the operating room)\nDoctor: We've confirmed that you have an internal hernia with closed loop obstruction. It appears to have been caused by an adhesion of a transverse colon epiploic appendage to the ascending colon mesentery. Unfortunately, the herniated small bowel is nonviable, so we had to resect, or remove, a total of 60 cm of your small bowel.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What happens next?\nDoctor: After the resection, we've left your small bowel in discontinuity and placed an abdominal wound-vac. You'll need to return to the operating room tomorrow for further assessment.\n(The following day)\nDoctor: We found that the terminal ileum was also nonviable, so we performed an ileocecectomy with enterocolonic anastomosis to repair the damage.\nPatient: Will I recover from this?\nDoctor: Your postoperative course may be complicated, but with proper care, you should recover. You'll be discharged approximately two weeks after the initial surgery. We'll monitor your progress closely and provide you with the necessary care during your recovery.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor.

Can you tell me more about it?\nParent: Yes, we noticed this mass at birth, and it's been painless but slowly growing. Our pediatrician did an ultrasound and thought it was a cystic mass, so they referred us for surgical excision.\nDoctor: I see. Based on the physical exam, we found a firm 2 × 2 cm subcutaneous lesion in the postauricular region. We also did an MRI which showed a 2.3 × 1.4 × 2.2 cm well-defined solid mass involving the outer table of the right temporal bone and temporoparietal suture with intense peripheral enhancement.\nParent: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that the mass is connected to the skull and has some abnormal growth. We performed an initial resection in the operating room and identified a deep plane between the mass and skull. We were able to remove the mass, but the pathology report showed that there were still some tumor cells at the peripheral margin.\nParent: So, what did you do next?\nDoctor: Your son underwent a repeat resection with a canal wall up mastoidectomy. We resected the lesion en bloc and drilled down to the inner table of the temporal bone. Although the bone appeared healthy, the pathology report again showed tumor cells at the soft tissue margins. Unfortunately, your son also had significant regrowth of the lesion.\nParent: That sounds concerning. What was the next step?\nDoctor: We brought your son back to the operating room for a revision mastoidectomy due to the impressive progression of the gross tumor, which was nearly 2.5 × 2.0 cm. We sought a neurosurgical consultation, and the mass was excised en bloc, resulting in a full-thickness craniectomy.\nParent: How did that go?\nDoctor: The dura, which is the outermost layer covering the brain, appeared healthy and unaffected by the tumor. We closed the wound, and your son was observed overnight in the PICU before being discharged home on postoperative day one in stable condition.\nParent: But then he developed an infection, right?\nDoctor: Yes, one month postoperatively, he developed purulence at his incision site, which required an intra-washout with neurosurgery. Fortunately, the infection resolved without any further complications or additional treatment requirements.\nParent: How is he doing now?\nDoctor: We saw your son at his six-month postoperative appointment, and I'm pleased to report that there is no evidence of disease.

We found that you have splenomegaly, which means your spleen is enlarged, about 9 cm below the costal margins. You also have tenderness in the left upper quadrant, but no rebound tenderness. Your laboratory examination results showed a hemoglobin level of 12.8 g/dL, platelet count of 124,000/mm, and white blood cell count of 6,500/mm with 62% neutrophils, 24% lymphocytes, and 7% eosinophils. Your liver enzymes, bilirubin, albumin, LDH, and chemistry panel were all within normal range.\nPatient: Hmm, okay. What about the ultrasound?\nDoctor: The abdominal ultrasound showed a large splenic cyst, about 15 cm in size, containing homogenous internal debris. We also did a computed tomography scan which showed the same 15 cm splenic cyst with parietal calcifications, compressing the stomach. It's most likely of hydatid origin.\nPatient: So what could be causing this?\nDoctor: Based on the findings, the differential diagnosis includes splenic abscess, hydatid cyst, epithelial cyst, and post-traumatic hemorrhage in a pre-existing epithelial cyst. We've narrowed it down to most likely being a hydatid cyst.\nPatient: Did you do any tests for infections or anything?\nDoctor: Yes, we performed serologic tests for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), HIV, toxoplasmosis, Entamoeba histolytica, Leishmania brazilensis, donovani, and EBV IgM. All of these tests came back negative.

We'll monitor you for a couple of days and then you can be discharged without needing physiotherapy.\n(A few days later)\nPatient: I came back to the emergency room because I started feeling tingling on my left side and my gait became unsteady again.\nDoctor: We'll perform an MRI brain and a dedicated MRI cervical spine to check for any issues.\n(After the MRI)\nDoctor: The MRI results show an acute posterior upper cervical cord infarction. Your CTA neck results show no restenosis of the left VA origin and the V4 segment is patent with resolution of the previously seen thrombus. Your physical examination revealed decreased vibration and proprioception, as well as dysmetria on the left upper and lower extremities with a positive Babinski sign. However, there's no loss of temperature or pain sensations.\nPatient: What's the plan now, doc?\nDoctor: We'll discharge you home and have you continue taking aspirin and clopidogrel. You'll also need outpatient physiotherapy to help with your recovery.\n(Three months later)\nPatient: My left-side tingling is gone, but I still have some mild coordination issues and gait imbalance.\nDoctor: That's an improvement from before. Keep up with the physiotherapy, and we'll continue monitoring your progress.",

    "dialogue": "Doctor: Hello, I'm here to discuss the report of your male baby who was born in a peripheral setting at 36 weeks of gestation to you, a 36-year-old primiparous mother. Your pregnancy was complicated by breech presentation and premature rupture of membranes at 34 weeks of gestation. Can you tell me about any symptoms you experienced during the pregnancy or delivery?\nMother: Yes, I had some difficulty during the delivery due to the breech presentation and the premature rupture of membranes.\nDoctor: I see. Your baby was delivered by emergency caesarean section with maternal general anaesthetic due to fetal distress and cord prolapse. His Apgar scores were 4, 5, 5, and 8 at one, five, ten, and fifteen minutes respectively. He required mask ventilation at birth for primary apnoea and was intubated at seven minutes of postnatal age for persistent apnoea. At 30 minutes of life, he was extubated to CPAP of 5 cmH2O, and FiO2 was weaned from 100 to 44%. How has his breathing been since then?\nMother: He seemed to be breathing a bit fast and with some effort, but I wasn't sure if it was normal or not.\nDoctor: It's normal to be concerned. On these settings, he had a tachypnoea of 90 breaths per minute with mildly increased respiratory effort and a pre-ductal oxygen saturation of ≥97%. We performed a capillary blood gas test, which excluded respiratory or metabolic acidosis. We also started him on empiric antibiotics, benzylpenicillin and gentamicin, to cover the risk of sepsis due to the prolonged rupture of membranes. We took chest x-rays at 2 and 4 hours of life, which showed crescent-shaped homogeneous opacities in both upper lung fields. The Neonatal and Paediatric Emergency Transport Service (NETS) was consulted.\nMother: What did they say?\nDoctor: Initial paediatric radiological advice via telemedicine was that this appearance could represent bilateral pleural effusions. Accordingly, the PEEP was increased to 8cmH2O; however, a lateral decubitus x-ray was uninformative. Due to the uncertainty regarding the cause of the respiratory distress, the baby was transferred to the local neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) by NETS at 10 hours of postnatal life.\nMother: Was there any progress after the transfer?\nDoctor: A progress CXR at just under 13 hours of age was still inconclusive. However, a lateral decubitus film performed concurrently demonstrated air anterior to the mediastinum, consistent with a diagnosis of pneumomediastinum. As a result, all respiratory support was ceased.\nMother: That's a relief. What about the risk of infection?\nDoctor: Laboratory markers for infection were negative, with a white cell count of 15.6 × 109. This is a good sign, as it indicates that there is no ongoing infection. We will continue to monitor him closely and provide any necessary care.\nMother: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate all the help and information.",

Can you tell me more about your medical history and any underlying diseases?\nPatient: Yes, I have poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and hyperthyroidism. I don't have any other medical illnesses or history of surgery. My family doesn't have any hematological disorders.\nDoctor: Alright, thank you for the information. It looks like your complete blood count in December 2016 showed a hemoglobin of 13 g/dl, a white blood cell count of 7 × 109/L, and a platelet count of 4 × 109/L. Your urinalysis and renal and liver function tests were normal. Your blood tests, including viral hepatitis, anti-human immunodeficiency virus, and antiphospholipid profiles, were all negative.

It seems that your platelet count responded well to the normal range with oral prednisolone, and the prednisolone was tapered in January 2017. But you had a relapse in August 2017, presenting with bleeding from the gums. Is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's when I had my first relapse.\nDoctor: I understand that your treatment was reinitiated with steroids, and once your CBC was normal, the treatment was gradually tapered. However, the last event occurred in October 2017, when your platelet count dropped to 36 × 109/L without any clinical bleeding. After treatment with high-dose prednisolone for 1 month, your platelet count recovered to the normal range. But you couldn't maintain your platelet count with prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg/day. Is that accurate?\nPatient: Yes, that's what happened.\nDoctor: Given your situation, I recommend a combination therapy of 50 mg/day of azathioprine and 200 mg/day of danazol, along with high-dose prednisolone. This should help you maintain your platelet count.\nPatient: Okay, I understand. What should I do if I experience any side effects or issues with this treatment?\nDoctor: If you experience any side effects or issues, please contact me or another healthcare professional immediately. We will closely monitor your condition and adjust the treatment if necessary.\nPatient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yeah, I've been experiencing some gait instability, like I'm having trouble walking. And I've also been having difficulty speaking and expressing myself.\nDoctor: I understand. You've had a thorough physical examination and we've noted your expressive aphasia and gait instability. You are otherwise hemodynamically stable, and your laboratory studies and urine drug screen came back negative. We performed a computed tomography (CT) of your head without contrast, and it showed a large right frontoparietal lesion with surrounding vasogenic edema.\nPatient: Oh my, that sounds serious. What does it mean?\nDoctor: We needed more information, so we did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further characterize the lesion. It showed a 5.5-cm mass in the deep white matter of your right frontal lobe, with gadolinium enhancement and a prominent FLAIR signal. This is concerning for malignancy.\nPatient: So, it could be cancer?\nDoctor: Yes, it's possible. To investigate further, we started you on dexamethasone and performed a frontal stereotactic brain biopsy. The initial pathology report showed a B-cell lymphoma, with cells positive for CD20 immunostain. However, due to the complexity of the case, we sent the sample for a second opinion at another institution.\nPatient: And what did they find?\nDoctor: The second opinion confirmed the presence of the MYD88L265P mutation. Because this mutation is strongly associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), we measured your quantitative serum immunoglobulins. The test showed an elevated IgM monoclonal paraprotein, which confirms the diagnosis of WM.\nPatient: So what's the plan for treatment?\nDoctor: We started you on a treatment regimen with rituximab, methylprednisolone, carfilzomib, and ibrutinib. You showed a good response to this treatment by MRI at three months, and we then transitioned you to oral ibrutinib only.\nPatient: That's good news, right?\nDoctor: Yes, but during a surveillance MRI at one year post-diagnosis, we found patchy right frontal lobe enhancement, indicating disease progression, even though you had no clinical symptoms. As a result, we restarted the initial chemo-immunotherapy protocol.\nPatient: But then what happened?\nDoctor: Unfortunately, we had to hold the ibrutinib due to thrombocytopenia. After that, you presented to the hospital again with cognitive dysfunction, leg weakness, and falls. An MRI showed significant disease progression.\nPatient: So what do we do now?\nDoctor: We've changed your treatment plan to palliative chemotherapy with high-dose methotrexate and rituximab. Your disease has responded well to this course of treatment.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate all that you're doing for me.",

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, my daughter has been looking pale for about a week now.\nDoctor: I understand that she was previously at a referral hospital where she received a red blood cell transfusion for severe anemia. Her hemoglobin level was 3.4 g/dL, which is quite low.\nPatient: Yes, that's correct. They started treating her for iron-deficiency anemia after they confirmed microcytosis, hypochromia, and low serum iron.\nDoctor: Right, her mean corpuscular volume was 74.6 fl and her mean cell hemoglobin was 21.5 pg, with a serum iron concentration of 1.28 umol/L. She was discharged after 1 week of treatment and her anemia was corrected, with her hemoglobin level at 12.4 g/dL. However, she had recurrent anemia over the next six months despite receiving another red blood cell transfusion.\nPatient: Yes, that's right. She also had some positive fecal occult blood test results intermittently.\nDoctor: I see. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed an increase in patch density in her left lower lobe (Fig. a) and right upper lobe (Fig. b) of her lung. She didn't have a history of repetitive haemoptysis, chronic cough, or dyspnoea, so idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis (IPH) was considered and her iron-deficiency anemia therapy was discontinued.\nPatient: So, she was referred here for further management. What's the plan now?\nDoctor: We performed a flexible bronchoscopy, but the bronchoalveolar lavage examination of blood-stained fluid and hemosiderin-laden macrophages from the involved areas was negative. A review of her chest CT scan showed no extensive ground glass opacities or reticular shadows, so diffuse alveolar haemorrhage was ruled out.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We also reviewed your daughter's history and found an episode of intermittent melena one month after the IDA treatment. The outpatient doctor thought it might be a side effect of the drug. Does your family have any related genetic history?\nPatient: No, we don't have any genetic history like that.\nDoctor: Okay, that's good to know. The physical exam demonstrated a girl of normal appearance, consistent with her ethnicity, except for the pallor. We decided to start a diagnostic approach for gastrointestinal bleeding.\nPatient: What does that involve?\nDoctor: Your daughter underwent both upper and lower endoscopy, but we found negative findings in all of the endoscopic examinations. We also performed a plain and enhanced CT of her abdomen and a technetium-99 scan.\nPatient: So, what are the results?",
    "soap": "S: The patient, a young girl, presented with a chief complaint of pallor persisting for about a week. She has a history of severe iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) treated with red blood cell transfusions and iron supplements. Despite treatment, she experienced recurrent anemia and intermittent positive fecal occult blood tests. There is no reported family history of related genetic conditions. The patient's mother reports an episode of melena following IDA treatment, suspected to be a drug side effect.\nO: Previous lab results showed hemoglobin at 3.4 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 74.6 fl, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) 21.5 pg, and serum iron 1.28 umol/L. Post-treatment hemoglobin improved to 12.4 g/dL. Recent imaging included a chest CT revealing increased patch density in the left lower and right upper lobes of the lung. Bronchoalveolar lavage was negative for hemosiderin-laden macrophages. Upper and lower endoscopies, as well as abdominal CT and technetium-99 scans, showed no abnormalities.\nA: The primary diagnosis is recurrent iron-deficiency anemia with suspected gastrointestinal bleeding as a potential underlying cause. Differential diagnoses previously considered included idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, which was ruled out based on imaging and bronchoscopy results. The negative endoscopic examinations and imaging studies make the source of bleeding unclear, complicating the diagnosis.\nP: The management plan includes further investigation into the cause of the gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient will continue monitoring with regular complete blood counts (CBC) and iron studies to assess anemia status. A repeat fecal occult blood test is scheduled to confirm ongoing bleeding. Nutritional counseling will be provided to ensure adequate iron intake. A follow-up with a pediatric gastroenterologist is recommended for potential exploratory procedures if bleeding persists or anemia recurs.

Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any unusual symptoms lately?\nPatient: Hmm, not really. I've been feeling okay.\nDoctor: I see. I understand you've recently started full masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel, is that correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: Your laboratory report showed that your hemoglobin is 168 g/L and hematocrit is 0.49, which are flagged as high based on female reference ranges. However, since you're on hormone therapy, we should actually be using the male reference ranges. For males, the hemoglobin reference range is 120-170g/L and hematocrit is 0.36-0.50.\nPatient: Oh, okay. So, what does that mean for me?\nDoctor: Androgens, like the testosterone you're taking, are known to stimulate erythropoiesis, which can result in an increase in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count. On the other hand, the impact of estrogens isn't as well understood. In trans individuals on feminizing hormone therapy with estradiol and anti-androgen, there's usually a significant decrease in hemoglobin and other blood parameters.\nPatient: I see. So, is this something I should be worried about?\nDoctor: It's worth noting that some studies suggest a higher hematocrit is associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. This is probably more of a consideration for people using masculinizing hormone therapy like you. However, since you've just started the therapy, your serum hematocrit levels might still be adjusting. It's evident that serum hematocrit levels in the affirmed gender's range can be seen from 3 months after commencing gender-affirming hormone therapy.\nPatient: Alright. Is there anything else I should be doing?\nDoctor: As smoking can also increase hematocrit levels, I would recommend smoking cessation if you're a smoker. This will help in maintaining healthy hematocrit levels and reduce any potential risks.\nPatient: Got it. I don't smoke, but that's good to know.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. For now, we'll continue monitoring your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels using the male reference ranges since you're on masculinizing hormone therapy. If there are any concerns regarding your levels in the future, we will address them accordingly.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for the explanation.\nDoctor: You're welcome.

They're angled wrong and stick out too much.\nDoctor: I see. Let's take a look and see what's going on. Hmm, I can see that your facial analysis shows a convex profile and mandibular asymmetry, with deviation to the right side. This probably caused the asymmetry on your upper arch. Your midline also has a 3-mm deviation compared to your facial midline, with angulation of the anterior teeth to the right side.\nPatient: Oh, really? That doesn't sound good.\nDoctor: Don't worry, we can still correct this. The analysis of your intraoral photographs shows a Class I relationship on both sides. One of the treatment options we can consider is extracting four premolars. This would address most of the issues with your teeth. However, it wouldn't correct the occlusal plane canting.\nPatient: Hmm, I don't think I want extractions. I'm worried about the spaces that would be created before they close with orthodontic mechanics.\nDoctor: I understand your concern. In that case, we can consider using skeletal anchorage to level the occlusal plane and create spaces to reduce the projection of your incisors and eliminate crowding in your lower arch.\nPatient: That sounds better. What does it involve?\nDoctor: We would bond standard Edgewise brackets with 0.022 × 0.028-in slots to your upper and lower arches, except for the lower incisors. Then, we would use different archwires to align and level your teeth, from 0.012 and 0.014-in nickel-titanium archwires up to rectangular 0.019 × 0.025-in archwires.\nPatient: Okay, and what about the skeletal anchorage?\nDoctor: We would position four miniplates, one in each posterior region of your quadrants. Next, we would start the intrusion on the left side of your upper arch by connecting elastomeric chains directly from the miniplate to the arch. This would apply a force of 200 g/f.\nPatient: How long would that take?\nDoctor: After about one month, we would start the retraction of both arches with elastics connected from the miniplates to hooks. The entire process may take some time, but it should help correct your teeth's angulation and crowding issues.\nPatient: Alright, let's go for it.

Your total white blood cell count was 0.52 × 10∧9/L, your neutrophil count was 0.04 × 10∧9/L, and your platelet count was 25 × 10∧9/L. All of these are well below the normal ranges.\nPatient: That sounds bad.\nDoctor: Yes, it is concerning. We had to give you intravenous antibiotics, specifically piperacillin/tazobactam, and growth factors for your neutropenic fever. You were hospitalized for 3 weeks before being discharged. How have you been feeling since then?\nPatient: I've been feeling better since I got out of the hospital, but still not great.\nDoctor: Given the stormy side effects of chemotherapy you experienced, we are highly suspicious that you may have a deficiency in DPD, which makes it difficult for your body to process the chemotherapy drugs. We'll need to do further tests to confirm this.\nPatient: Okay, what do I need to do?\nDoctor: We'll schedule further tests to confirm the DPD deficiency, and based on the results, we may need to adjust your chemotherapy regimen. In the meantime, please continue to monitor your symptoms and let us know if anything changes.\nPatient: Alright, thank you, Doctor.",

Can you tell me more about your symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, I've noticed that this mass in my abdomen has been getting bigger, and I've been experiencing frequent urination for the past two months.\nDoctor: Alright. Do you have any chronic medical conditions or have you had any surgeries in the past?\nPatient: No, I don't have any chronic conditions and I've never had any surgeries.\nDoctor: Have you been exposed to any carcinogenic substances, alcohol, tobacco, or drugs?\nPatient: No, I've never been exposed to any of those.\nDoctor: Are you married and do you have any children?\nPatient: Yes, I am married and have four children.\nDoctor: Thank you for the information. During the physical examination, we found that you have a blood pressure of 128/82 mmHg, heart rate at 78 beats per minute, and a temperature of 37.4 °C. We also noticed a firm, non-tender, non-mobile, hypogastric mass projecting approximately 20 cm above the pubic symphysis. Additionally, we found that you have only one testis in the right scrotum, with the contralateral scrotum and inguinal canal being empty. There were no palpable inguinal lymph nodes or ascites.\nPatient: Oh, I see.\nDoctor: We also performed a neurological assessment and found conserved muscle forces and sensitivity in all four limbs, with all reflexes being conserved. Paraclinical investigations revealed no hematuria and proteinuria on urine analysis, normal white cell and platelet count on the full blood count, no blast cells on the blood smear, and a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology.\nPatient: That's good to know.\nDoctor: A pelvic ultrasound was also done, and it revealed a heterogeneous bean-shaped mass lying above your bladder, approximately 10 cm by 7 cm in size, with five smaller satellite masses. Your kidneys, bladder, and bowels had no abnormalities. Given these findings, our probable diagnosis is enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that there is a possibility that you have enlarged lymph nodes in the abdominal region. To further investigate this, we scheduled an exploratory laparotomy for you.\nPatient: What happened during the laparotomy?\nDoctor: During the exploratory laparotomy, we found a highly vascularized mass fixed to the left inguinal ligament, projecting into the retroperitoneum, with several other small satellite masses attached posteriorly.\nPatient: What does this mean for me?\nDoctor: We will further analyze the findings and discuss the appropriate treatment options with you. It is important to continue monitoring your symptoms and follow up with us as needed.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything.",

I'm here to report the case of a 91-year-old woman who developed a generalized maculopapular skin eruption after using icodextrin dialysate solutions for CAPD. Can you tell me about your medical history?\nPatient: Yes, doctor. I have stage IV congestive heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, secondary to massive tricuspid valve failure and severe mitral valve deficiency. I also have chronic atrial fibrillation (cAF) and stage 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with an estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate (eGFR) of 20 ml/min/1.73m2.\nDoctor: Thank you for sharing that information. I understand that you had a Tenckhoff peritoneal catheter surgically inserted recently. Can you tell me about your experience during your prolonged hospitalization in the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit?\nPatient: Yes, I was in the hospital for a while because there was leakage from the peritoneal catheter exit site. I was eventually discharged, and my CAPD regimen included 2 icodextrin exchanges per day.\nDoctor: That's correct. The daily dose of icodextrin relative to your body weight was 41.7 ml/kg, and the peritoneal ultrafiltration volume was 600 ml/day. You were then re-evaluated 7 days later, and the CAPD regimen was intensified with the addition of another exchange during the day with dialysate glucose 1.36%. This resulted in a peritoneal ultrafiltration of approximately 800 ml/day.\nPatient: Yes, that's right.\nDoctor: On Day 15 after your initial exposure to icodextrin, you were admitted to the Peritoneal Dialysis Unit due to a widespread maculopapular and exfoliative skin rash extending over your abdomen, arms, legs, and back. Can you describe how the rash looked and felt?\nPatient: It was a sudden skin rash that was red and bumpy, covering a large area of my body. It was very itchy and uncomfortable.\nDoctor: Thank you for providing that information. During your admission, we conducted a physical examination. Your normal body temperature was 36.7 °C, blood pressure 105/60 mmHg, pulse rate 70 bpm, oxygen saturation 95% in the room air, and there was an absence of abnormal clinical signs from the chest auscultation and palpation of the abdomen.\nPatient: Okay, so what's the next step, doctor?\nDoctor: We will continue to closely monitor your condition and adjust your CAPD regimen as needed to minimize the risk of further skin eruptions. It's important that you report any new symptoms or changes in your health to your healthcare team promptly.\nPatient: Thank you, doctor. I'll make sure to keep you updated on my condition.\n[If the patient eventually dies, the conversation could continue with the patient's family:]\nDoctor: I'm very sorry to inform you that your loved one has passed away. We did everything we could to treat her condition and manage her symptoms, but unfortunately, her health continued to decline. Please accept my deepest condolences.\nFamily: Thank you, doctor.

Can you tell me more about your recent symptoms?\nPatient: Yes, over the past few weeks, I've had progressive right upper extremity weakness and increasing confusion.\nDoctor: Have you had any prior cardiac surgery or known cardiac abnormalities?\nPatient: No, I haven't.\nDoctor: Okay. During your physical exam, we found that you have normal cardiac findings, 3/5 strength in your right arm, you were afebrile, and your white cell count was elevated at > 170 × 103/μL, which is at your baseline. We focused our initial workup on your neurologic complaints. We conducted a brain MRI, which revealed multiple bilateral rim-enhancing brain lesions with surrounding vasogenic edema. The differential diagnosis included embolic or metastatic lesions, with a high suspicion for metastatic disease given your presentation and history.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds concerning.\nDoctor: Yes, we needed to determine the cause of these lesions. We conducted a workup for primary malignancy which came back negative. You then underwent a right craniotomy for biopsy. The resected lesion contained necrotic tissue with branching fungal hyphae suggestive of Aspergillus. Tissue cultures revealed Aspergillus Fumigatus species.\nPatient: What's the treatment for that?\nDoctor: We started you on IV Voraconazole (6 mg/kg every 12 h day 1 then 4 mg/kg every 12 h) and Micafungin (100 mg daily). The Galactomannan assay was positive, but all blood cultures were negative.\nPatient: Okay, so what's next?\nDoctor: We performed a 2D echocardiogram to evaluate for a possible embolic source for the brain abscesses. This revealed a 1.3 × 1.1 cm pedunculated mass in the inferior wall of the left ventricle. There was no evidence of any cardiac dysfunction, and your LV ejection fraction was measured at 55%.\nPatient: What does that mean?\nDoctor: We needed to consult cardiac surgery to remove the mass. You underwent a median sternotomy with cardiopulmonary bypass for removal of the left ventricular mass using a left atriotomy incision. The mitral valve was inspected through the incision and demonstrated no vegetations. A retractor was placed through the mitral valve, and the left ventricular mass was easily identified and removed.\nPatient: So, the mass is gone now?\nDoctor: Yes, it was a 1 cm soft, smooth appearing mass found adhered to the inferior septal portion of the left ventricle. The surgery was successful in removing it.\nPatient: That's a relief. What are the next steps for my care?\nDoctor: We will continue monitoring you and treating the Aspergillus infection. You'll need to keep taking the prescribed medications and follow up with us regularly to ensure your recovery proceeds smoothly.",

Can you tell me what happened?\nPatient: Yes, I suddenly collapsed at home and my family called 911. They performed CPR and I was resuscitated.\nDoctor: I see. After the resuscitation, we recorded your heart rhythm which showed ventricular fibrillation. Due to respiratory insufficiency, we had to intubate you and set up mechanical ventilation. We also performed an Electrocardiography which revealed ST-segment depressions up to 1 mm in I, aVL, II, III, and V1-4 leads.\nPatient: Oh, that sounds serious. What does that mean?\nDoctor: It indicates some abnormalities in your heart rhythm and function. When you were transported to the emergency department, you were hemodynamically stable and had preserved systolic blood pressure without the need for inotropes.\nPatient: That's good to know. So, what happened next?\nDoctor: We performed blood tests and found an elevated level of serum D-dimers, which led us to perform computed tomography of your head and chest in a pulmonary embolism algorithm. It showed signs of cerebral stroke and evident pulmonary embolism.\nPatient: Oh no, that's terrible.\nDoctor: Yes, it is concerning. The chest radiograph also depicted features of pulmonary edema. At that time, we requested a cardiological consultation, and the cardiologist ordered an echocardiography at your bedside.\nPatient: And what did that show?\nDoctor: The echocardiography revealed impaired left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) of about 25-30%, regional contractility impairment with recent akinesis of the lateral, inferior, and posterior walls, hypokinesis of other walls, and moderate mitral regurgitation.\nPatient: That sounds complicated. What does it mean for me?\nDoctor: It means that your heart function is significantly impaired, which could have contributed to your cardiac arrest. Based on these findings, you were immediately qualified for coronary artery angiography and transferred from the emergency department to the catheterization laboratory (CathLab).\nPatient: What happened during the transportation?\nDoctor: During the transportation to the CathLab, the first symptoms of cardiogenic shock (CS) developed, and you were given the first inotrope—noradrenaline.\nPatient: What did the angiography show?\nDoctor: The coronary artery angiography revealed multivessel disease including a recessive right coronary artery with 60% stenosis, left main coronary artery without significant stenoses, ostial occlusion of the dominant circumflex branch (Cx), left anterior descending artery (LAD) with multiple significant stenoses, and intermediate branch with 80-90% ostial stenosis.\nPatient: What does that mean for my treatment?\nDoctor: Based on these findings, you will require percutaneous coronary intervention to help improve blood flow to your heart and prevent further complications.\nPatient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me, doctor.",

You mentioned you're a 70-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and you received a kidney transplant in 2011, correct?\nPatient: Yes, that's right. I've been on tacrolimus, prednisone, and mycophenolate since then.\nDoctor: Okay, let's review your recent tests. Your creatinine level at presentation was 3.4 mg/dL, up from a baseline of 1.2 mg/dL on prior studies. We found a positive stool infectious panel PCR for norovirus during your inpatient hospital evaluation. Clostridium difficile study was negative, and your fecal fat content was within normal limits. \nPatient: Hmm, so what does that mean?\nDoctor: It means that you have an infection with norovirus, which might be causing your symptoms. We decided to discontinue your mycophenolate medication as it could be contributing to your symptoms as a side effect. We started you on azathioprine for immunosuppression instead.\nPatient: Yes, I remember that. But my symptoms didn't really improve much.\nDoctor: Right. So, we treated you with a 3-day course of 500 mg PO nitazoxanide twice daily, which showed modest improvement. However, your symptoms reoccurred, and we decided to give you a second, longer course of nitazoxanide for 3 weeks.\nPatient: And my symptoms did resolve within a week of that treatment, but they came back again in the following 3 months.\nDoctor: Yes, we noticed that your stool biofire PCRs were persistently positive for norovirus when checked monthly over the following 5-month time period. That's when we decided to start you on a 3-week course of high-dose nitazoxanide (500 mg PO every eight hours).\nPatient: Oh, I remember that. It was difficult to tolerate due to gastrointestinal distress.\nDoctor: Yes, we then decreased the frequency of administration to twice daily, and you completed the three weeks of nitazoxanide treatment. Your gastrointestinal symptoms have since resolved.\nPatient: Yes, I've been feeling much better and haven't had any issues since then.\nDoctor: That's great to hear. We did a repeat stool PCR for norovirus 10 days after completion of therapy, and it was negative. You're now considered asymptomatic, which is a good sign.\nPatient: That's a relief.
