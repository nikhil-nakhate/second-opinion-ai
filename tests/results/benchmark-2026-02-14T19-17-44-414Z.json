However, thoroughness was limited - the headache complaint (chief concern) was inadequately explored (no questions about severity, frequency, location, triggers, or red flags). Safety concerns include: (1) no specific guidance on headache red flags in pregnancy, (2) vague monitoring plan without concrete next steps, (3) no discussion of delivery planning given previous preeclampsia/IUGR and aortic stenosis. Empathy was moderate - professional but somewhat technical/distant. The follow-up plan lacked specificity regarding headache management, specialist referrals (maternal-fetal medicine, cardiology), blood pressure monitoring protocols, or criteria for seeking urgent care. For a high-risk pregnancy with complex cardiovascular pathology, more detailed multidisciplinary care coordination was needed."
