His chest x-ray was unremarkable and he has received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccination.\n Additional Testing: We will obtain a COVID-19 test to rule this out.\n Medical Treatment: I recommend he use Robitussin for cough, as well as ibuprofen or Tylenol if he develops a fever.\n\nDepression.\n Medical Reasoning: He has been practicing barre classes and is doing well overall.\n Medical Treatment: I offered medication or psychotherapy, but the patient opted to defer at this time.\n\nDiabetes type 2.\n Medical Reasoning: His blood glucose levels have been well controlled based on home monitoring, but his recent hemoglobin A1c was elevated.\n Additional Testing: We will repeat a hemoglobin A1c in 4 months.\n Medical Treatment: We will increase his metformin to 1000 mg twice daily.\n\nHypertension.\n Medical Reasoning: He has been compliant with lisinopril and his blood pressures have been well controlled based on home monitoring.\n Additional Testing: We will order a lipid panel.\n Medical Treatment: He will continue on lisinopril 20 mg once daily.
