Safety was reasonable with appropriate symptom screening initially, though no specific emergency warning signs were discussed. Empathy was moderate - professional but somewhat clinical in tone without acknowledging the anxiety of a high-risk pregnancy. The differential diagnosis explanation was accurate but potentially overwhelming for the patient without sufficient contextualization. Follow-up recommendations were vague ('continue monitoring,' 'regular check-ups') without specifying frequency, blood pressure monitoring protocols, preeclampsia warning signs, or when exactly to seek urgent care. The plan lacked specificity for managing headaches in this high-risk context and didn't address whether current medications are safe/sufficient."

        "notes": "The doctor demonstrated good diagnostic thoroughness with systematic testing (vitals, labs, imaging, bronchoscopy, angiography) and accurate medical communication. However, there are significant safety concerns: no emergency assessment despite life-threatening hemoptysis, no discussion of warning signs to watch for, and vague post-surgical follow-up instructions. The empathy was adequate but somewhat clinical - brief acknowledgment of patient concerns but limited emotional support for a serious diagnosis requiring surgery. The follow-up plan was too generic ('monitor closely, follow up regularly') without specific instructions about activity restrictions, wound care, or when to seek urgent care. More patient education about the condition and clearer discharge planning would improve quality."
